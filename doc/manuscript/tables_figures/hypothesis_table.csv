1,1,,,How does interannual climate variation shape tree growth?,,
1,,1.1,water,"Drought limits growth, but water responses are nonlinear.",,
0,,,,Water influences growth over relatively long seasonal windows (≥3 months). ,7 / 10 sites,issue 122
1,,,,"Growth respones to water are predominantly positive, ",98% (42/43) SSC ,"45 SSC considered, P effect in 43; issue 122"
1,,,,...but these positive responses decelerate or decline at high precipitation.,76% (32/42) SSC ,
1,,1.2,temp,"High temperature (T) limits growth, often nonlinearly.",,
0,,,,Growth is most sensitive to T over relatively short seasonal windows (≤3 months). ,9 / 10 sites,issue 122
0,,,,Growth responds more strongly to maximum T or PET than tominimum T.,8 / 10 sites,issue 122
1,,,,Growth respones to T are predominantly either negative…,13 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
1,,,,…or non-linear concave down.,18 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
1,,,,"However, there are cases where growth increases with T.",7 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
1,,1.3,climate x DBH,Climate sensitivity often varies with tree diameter (DBH).,49% of SSVC,RW; issue 122
1,,,,Water and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,16 / 36 SSC,RW; issue 122
1,,,,Temperature and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,12 / 32 SSC,RW; issue 122
1,2,,,How does growth rate vary with DBH?,,
1,,2.1,RW,DBH - ring width (RW) relationships depend upon the light environment.,,
1,,,,"RW declines with DBH for light-demanding species,",46% (6/13) SSC,
1,,,,...but increases with DBH for shade-tolerant species.,73% (8/11) SSC,
1,,2.2,BAI & AGB,Basal area and biomass increments peak at intermediate DBH.,,
1,,,,Basal area increment (BAI) peaks at intermediate DBH.,95% (41/43) SSC,
1,,,,Biomass increment (∆AGB) peaks at intermediate DBH.,98% (42/43) SSC,
1,3,,,How have size-corrected growth rates changed through time? ,,
1,,3.1,disturbed,Size-corrected growth rates decline with time since disturbance.,,
1,,,,"In secondary or disturbed forests, growth rates of most species have declined. ",XX / XX  sp. at 7 sites,
1,,3.2,old-growth,"In largely undisturbed forests, growth trends are mixed.",,
1,,,,"In these forests, growth rates of some species have declined,",XX / XX sp. at 3 sites,
1,,,,….whereas others have increased.,3 / XX sp. at 3 sites,
