1,1,,,How does interannual climate variation shape annual tree growth?,,
2,,1.1,water,"  Multi-month drought limits growth, but water responses are nonlinear.",,
3,,,,    Water influences growth over relatively long seasonal windows (≥3 months). ,7 / 10 sites,issue 122
4,,,,"    Growth respones to water are predominantly positive, ",98% (42/43) SSC ,"45 SSC considered, P effect in 43; issue 122"
5,,,,    ...but these positive responses decelerate or decline at high precipitation.,76% (32/42) SSC ,
6,,1.2,temp,"  Over shorter time scales, high temperature (T) limits growth, often nonlinearly.",,
7,,,,    Growth is most sensitive to T over relatively short seasonal windows (≤3 months). ,9 / 10 sites,issue 122
8,,,,    Growth responds more strongly to maximum T or PET than to  minimum T.,8 / 10 sites,issue 122
9,,,,    Growth respones to T are predominantly either negative…,13 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
10,,,,    …or non-linear concave down.,18 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
11,,,,"    However, there are cases where growth increases with T.",7 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
12,,1.3,climate x DBH,  Climate sensitivity often varies with tree diameter (DBH).,49% of SSVC,RW; issue 122
13,,,,    Water and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,16 / 36 SSC,RW; issue 122
14,,,,    Temperature and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,12 / 32 SSC,RW; issue 122
15,2,,,How does growth rate vary with DBH?,,
16,,2.1,RW,  Ontogenetic patterns in ring width (RW) depend upon  light environment.,,
17,,,,"    RW declines with DBH for light-demanding species,",46% (6/13) SSC,
18,,,,    ...but increases with DBH for shade-tolerant species.,73% (8/11) SSC,
19,,2.2,BAI & AGB,  Basal area or biomass increments peak at intermediate DBH.,,
20,,,,    Basal area increment (BAI) peaks at intermediate DBH.,95% (41/43) SSC,
21,,,,    Biomass increment (∆AGB) peaks at intermediate DBH.,98% (42/43) SSC,
22,3,,,How have growth rates changed through time? ,,
23,,3.1,disturbed,  Size-corrected growth rates decline with time since disturbance.,,
24,,,,"    In secondary or disturbed forests, growth rates of most species have declined. ",XX / XX  sp. at 7 sites,
25,,3.2,old-growth,"  In old-growth forests, growth trends are mixed and more dependant on external drivers.",,
26,,,,"    In relatively undisturbed old-growth forests, growth rates of some species have declined,",XX / XX sp. at 3 sites,
27,,,,    ….whereas others have increased.,3 / XX sp. at 3 sites,
