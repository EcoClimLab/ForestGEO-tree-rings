4,,,,"    Growth respones to water are predominantly positive, ",98% (42/43) SSC ,"45 SSC considered, P effect in 43; issue 122"
5,,,,    ...but these positive responses decelerate or decline at high precipitation.,76% (32/42) SSC ,
6,,1.2,temp,"  Over shorter time scales, high temperature (T) limits growth, often nonlinearly.",,
7,,,,    Growth is most sensitive to T over relatively short seasonal windows (≤3 months). ,9 / 10 sites,issue 122
