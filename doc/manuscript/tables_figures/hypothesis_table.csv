1,1,,,How does interannual climate variation shape annual tree growth?,,
2,,1.1,water,"  Multi-month drought limits growth, but precipitation responses are nonlinear.",,
3,,,,    The time window over which precipitation influences growth is usually ≥3 months. ,7 / 10 sites,
4,,,,"    Growth respones to precipitataion are predominantly positive, ",42 / 43 SSC ,
5,,,,    ...but these positive responses decelerate or decline at high precipitation.,32 / 42 SSC ,
6,,1.2,temp,"  Over shorter time scales, high temperatures limit growth, often nonlinearly.",,
7,,,,    The time window over which temperature influences growth rarely exceeds 3 months. ,9 / 10 sites,
8,,,,    Annual growth responds more strongly to $T_{max}$ or $PET$ than to  $T_{min}$.,8 / 10 sites,
9,,,,    Growth respones to temperature are predominantly either negative…,13 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, P effect in 43"
10,,,,    …or non-linear concave down,18 / 38 SSC,
11,,,,"    However, there are cases where growth increases with temperature.",7 / 38 SSC,
12,,1.3,climate x DBH,  Climate sensitivity varies with tree diameter (DBH).,44% of SSCV,
13,,,,    Water and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,X% of SSCV,
14,,,,    Temperature and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,X% of SSCV,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38"
15,2,,,How does growth rate vary with DBH?,,
16,,2.1,Size,"  Growth rate, by any metric, varies nonlinearly with DBH.",X% of SSCV,
17,,,,"    Ring width increment (RW) declines with DBH for trees established in the open,",,
18,,,,    ...but increases with DBH for trees established in the understory.,,
19,,,,    Basal area increment (BAI) peaks at intermediate DBH.,,
20,,,,    Biomass increment (∆AGB) peaks at intermediate DBH.,98% of SSC,
21,3,,,How have growth rates changed through time? ,,
22,,3.1,year,  Growth rates of most forest tree populations have declined through time.,90% of SSC,
23,,,,"    In secondary or disturbed forests, growth rates of most species have declined. ",XX / XX  sp. at 7 sites,
24,,,,"    In old-growth forests, growth  rates of some species has declined,",XX / XX sp. at 3 sites,
25,,,,    ….whereas others have increased.,3 / XX sp. at 3 sites,
