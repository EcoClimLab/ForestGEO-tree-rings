1,,,How does interannual climate variation shape annual tree growth?,,
,1.1,water,"Multi-month drought limits growth, but water responses are nonlinear.",,
,,,Water influences growth over relatively long seasonal windows (≥3 months). ,7 / 10 sites,issue 122
,,,"Growth respones to water are predominantly positive, ",98% (42/43) SSC ,"45 SSC considered, P effect in 43; issue 122"
,,,...but these positive responses decelerate or decline at high precipitation.,76% (32/42) SSC ,
,1.2,temp,"Over shorter time scales, high temperature (T) limits growth, often nonlinearly.",,
,,,Growth is most sensitive to T over relatively short seasonal windows (≤3 months). ,9 / 10 sites,issue 122
,,,Growth responds more strongly to maximum T or PET than tominimum T.,8 / 10 sites,issue 122
,,,Growth respones to T are predominantly either negative…,13 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
,,,…or non-linear concave down.,18 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
,,,"However, there are cases where growth increases with T.",7 / 38 SSC,"45 SSC considered, T effect in 38; issue 122"
,1.3,climate x DBH,Climate sensitivity often varies with tree diameter (DBH).,49% of SSVC,RW; issue 122
,,,Water and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,16 / 36 SSC,RW; issue 122
,,,Temperature and DBH have an interactive effect on growth.,12 / 32 SSC,RW; issue 122
2,,,How does growth rate vary with DBH?,,
,2.1,RW,Ontogenetic patterns in ring width (RW) depend uponlight environment.,,
,,,"RW declines with DBH for light-demanding species,",46% (6/13) SSC,
,,,...but increases with DBH for shade-tolerant species.,73% (8/11) SSC,
,2.2,BAI & AGB,Basal area or biomass increments peak at intermediate DBH.,,
,,,Basal area increment (BAI) peaks at intermediate DBH.,95% (41/43) SSC,
,,,Biomass increment (∆AGB) peaks at intermediate DBH.,98% (42/43) SSC,
3,,,How have growth rates changed through time? ,,
,3.1,disturbed,Size-corrected growth rates decline with time since disturbance.,,
,,,"In secondary or disturbed forests, growth rates of most species have declined. ",XX / XX  sp. at 7 sites,
,3.2,old-growth,"In old-growth forests, growth trends are mixed and more dependant on external drivers.",,
,,,"In relatively undisturbed old-growth forests, growth rates of some species have declined,",XX / XX sp. at 3 sites,
,,,….whereas others have increased.,3 / XX sp. at 3 sites,
