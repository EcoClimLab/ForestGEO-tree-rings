## `r site_details_appendix_title`

### Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama

Cores were collected within the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), a 5600-ha reserve established in 1923 that includes Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and the surrounding mainland peninsulas [@alfaro-sanchez_growth_2017]. 
BCNM contains a mix of old-growth and mature secondary tropical moist forest. 
Live canopy trees on the peninsulas were cored between January 2015 and April 2015. 
In addition, several fallen dead trees on BCI were sampled by taking discs with chain saws. 

We note that the secondary forest status of much of BCNM differs from ForestGEO's 50-ha plot on BCI, which is old-growth, and shows little directional trend in woody productivity [@rutishauser_testing_2020].

### Huai Kha Khaeng, Thailand

Cores were collected within a ~300 ha acre area of seasonal dry evergreen and mixed deciduous forest in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK).
The site underwent a widespread, catastrophic disturbance in the mid-1800s and several smaller, more localized disturbances in the 1910s, 1940s, and 1960s [@baker_disturbance_2005].

Cores were collected between December 2010 and December 2011, sampling trees >5 cm DBH with the goal or representing a random subset of the local population of the target species. 
Details are given in @vlam_temperature_2014.

### Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Virginia, USA

Cores were collected within the ForestGEO plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). 
The forest is a secondary temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, which developed following agricultural abandonment in the mid 19th-century, dominated by the species included in our analysis [@bourg_initial_2013]. 
Specifically, the 14 species sampled together account for 97% of woody productivity at the site [@helcoski_growing_2019].

In 2010-2011, cores were collected from a random subset of live trees $\ge$ 10 cm DBH.
In 2016 and 2017, cores were extracted from trees found newly dead during an annual tree mortality census [@gonzalez-akre_patterns_2016].
Details are given in @helcoski_growing_2019.

### Lilly Dickey Woods, Indiana, USA

Lilly Dickey Woods (LDW) is a secondary temperate broadleaf deciduous forest dominated by oaks (*Quercus* spp.) and hickories (*Carya* spp.).

Cores were collected outside the ForestGEO plot, but within a contiguous patch of forest.
In 2012 - 2014, cores were collected from live or dead dominant canopy trees with morphological characteristics typical of older trees [@maxwell_declining_2016].
In 2020, additional cores were collected following an ecological study design, wherein all live trees $\ge$ **##** cm within a **(SIZE)** plot were sampled.

### Harvard Forest, USA

Harvard Forest (HF) is a secondary temperate mixed forest dominated by *Tsuga canadensis* and northern hardwood species including *Quercus rubra*, *Acer rubrum*, and *Betula alleghaniensis*.
Cores were collected within the ForestGEO megaplot, and in the footprint of the original HF eddy-flux tower [@finzi_carbon_2020]. 
Samples were collected following an ecological study design [@dye_comparing_2016], wherein all living or dead trees $\ge$ 10 cm DBH within a **(SIZE)** plot were cored.

### $\v{Z}$of$\'{i}$n Forest Dynamics Plot, Czech Republic

The $\v{Z}$of$\'{i}$n forest (ZOF) is a well-preserved natural forest remnant dominated by *Fagus sylvatica* L., *Picea abies* L. and *Abies alba* Mill.
The forest is not fully without past human direct interventions, and a limited historical land use effect is also possible [see @kozakova_contrasting_2011].
Acid deposition dramatically reduced growth in the late 20th century, with peak influence between the 1970s and the early 1990s [@elling_dendroecological_2009; @samonil_long-term_2008].

In total, 2210 individuals were cored either within the 25 ha ForestGEO plot or a larger, 74 ha plot in which it is embedded. 
The tree-ring data were collected for several studies around 2010 [@samonil_individual-based_2013; @samonil_disturbances_2014; @samonil_uncertainty_2015; @samonil_uncertainty_2016; @vasickova_true_2016; @vasickova_driving_2019; @kaspar_species-specific_nodate]. 
The sampling strategy was mainly connected with the disturbance history of the forest and evaluation of growth of juvenile trees in gaps. 
Therefore, these data consist mainly of dominant and codominant tree species and relatively low number of young trees. 

### Niobrara, Nebraska, USA

The Niobrara site sits at the prairie-forest ecotone of the North American Great Plains. 
There, forests occur in cool, moist canyons formed by spring-fed tributaries along the Niobrara River. 
Cores were taken from seven north-facing *Betula papyrifera* stands along a 27 km section of the Niobrara River, as detailed in @bumann_assessing_2019.
The largest healthy trees within each stand were selected for coring.

### Little Tesuque, New Mexico, USA
The Little Tesuque (LT) site is in a mature dry mixed conifer forest outside of Santa Fe, NM, in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
The site had not undergone stand-clearing disturbance (e.g., fire) in more than one hundred years.
The growth of trees in the region, including at this site, are being severely affected by a strong drying trend under climate change [@touchan_millennial_2011; @williams_temperature_2013], with many missing growth rings in recent years.

In 2020, live canopy and sub-canopy trees, all >20 cm DBH, were sampled within a 1 ha plot (Little Tesuque plot 3; *lts3*). 

### Cedar Breaks, Utah, USA
Cores were collected within the Utah Forest Dynamics Plot ForestGEO plot on the Colorado Plateau in Cedar Breaks National Monument [CB; @furniss_reconciling_2017]. 
The plot sits on the edge of cliff, which descends ~750 m to a valley below.
The mature spruce-fir forest is dominated by the species analyzed here (*Abies bifolia*, *Populus tremuloides*, *Picea engelmannii*, *Pinus flexilis*, *Pinus longaeva*, *Picea pungens*, and *Pseudotsuga menziesii*).
The site is largely undisturbed. 
The most recent fire occurred in 1802, and many currently living trees established before then. Living *Pinus longaeva* at the site date back ~1600 years, and deadwood at the site dates back to 0 AD (Cooper & Lutz, unpublished data).

In 2019, living individuals of each dominant species were cored.  
Chronologies are published on ITRDB [@birch_birch_2020; @birch_birch_2020-2; @birch_birch_2020-3; @birch_birch_2020-4].

### Scotty Creek, Northwest Territories, Canada
The Scotty Creek site is a black spruce (*Picea mariana*) forest on rapidly thawing discontinuous permafrost [@sniderhan_growth_2016; @dearborn_permafrost_2020].
Vertical permafrost thaw has been causing drought stress in the shallow-rooted trees, resulting in growth declines [@sniderhan_growth_2016] and high mortality [@dearborn_permafrost_2020].

In the summers of 2012 and 2013, seven forest stands within a 2 km^2^ area were sampled.
In five stands with clearly defined boundaries at edges of permafrost plateaus, all living and dead trees $\ge$ 7 cm DBH were cored. 
In two stands without well-defined edges, cores were taken from a >7 cm DBH tree nearest to every 20 m interval in a 100 × 100 m grid, totaling 36 trees per stand.
Sampling details are given in @sniderhan_growth_2016.

## `r DBH_reconstruction_title`

*This is still rough/ mostly notes.*

In most cases, when a recent $DBH$ measurement was available, $DBH$ was reconstructed from the outside in. 
In cases where $DBH$ was not available, but when we knew that the core hit pith or could reasonably estimate how far off it was based on the curvature of the rings [@applequist_simple_1958; @duncan_evaluation_1989], $DBH$ was reconstructed from the inside out. 

For each core, $DBH$ can be reconstructed outside-in (based on recent $DBH$, subtracting growth recorded in tree rings) or inside-out (summing $RW$ from the inside out,--only when core hit pith or distance to pith can be reliably estimated). 
We generally gave precedence to the outside-in approach.
Specifically, when $DBH$ was taken at the time of coring,  
At some of our sites where DBH was not taken at the time of coring (*SCBI*,), DBH measurements taken before or slightly after the time of coring could be used.
(see [issue #19 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/19))
If before, ... 
If after...
For all outside-in reconstructions, if a negative $DBH$ was predicted...

When there were more than one cores for a tree, the $DBH$ reconstructions from each core were averaged to produce a single estimate of the tree's $DBH$ through time. 
When the start or end dates of the records from the cores differed, we extrapolated growth of the shorter core to match the years covered by the longer core. 
Specifically, to fill in years at the more recent end, we assumed that the average growth rate of the ten years prior to the missing records applied to the missing years. 
To fill in years at the beginning of the tree's lifespan, we likewise assumed that the ten years adjacent to the missing record applied to the missing years; however, if this yielded a negative $DBH$ estimate for the earliest year in the reconstruction, we divided the existing minimum $DBH$ by number of years missing and applied that value to each year.
We note that these reconstructed growth records were used only for the reconstruction of $DBH$ and were not included as response variables in any of our analyses.


In either case we need bark thickness--ideally allometries describing the relationship between DBH and bark thickness (Table S4). 
This is especially critical for thick-barked species.
When bark thickness data were available, we generated allometries ([issue #8 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/8))... 
lognormal model with intercept forced to zero: `lm(bark_depth.mm ~ -1 + log(dbh_no_bark.cm+1):bark_species, data = bark)`.
When bark thickness data were not available, we used published bark allometries from other sources (Table S4)

## `r climate_correction_title`

*For BCNM, we calculated monthly $PPT$ and $PDF$ from daily precipitation readings made on BCNM starting in 1929 [@paton_barro_2019].*

\newpage

## `r traditional_comparison_title`

To test whether our methods gave similar results to traditional methods, we conducted qualitative comparisons of our results to previous studies based on the same cores (Table `r qualitative_results_comparison`) and conducted a formal quantitative comparison for four species (Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`), as detailed below. 

*Qualitative comparison*

For all species-site combinations, we reviewed previous studies characterizing the climate sensitivity of growth using conventional methods. 
In most cases, we were able to compare with previous studies from the same sites and sets of cores. 
When these were not available, we reviewed regional-level analyses believed to be representative of the site. 

Results from previous studies were compiled alongside results from the climate-only model in this study (Table `r qualitative_results_comparison`). 
Where previous studies examined numerous climate variables or time windows [e.g., @helcoski_growing_2019], we focus on those most relevant to our findings. 

Beyond the methodological differences, original studies based on the same sets of cores varied from this one and from one another in factors including
the exact set of cores analyzed,
climate data sources,
time frame of analysis,
approaches to identifying candidate climate variables and windows (including whether this is done on a site or species level), 
methods for detrending and standardizing to build chronologies,
and whether the effects of temperature and precipitation are considered separately (original studies) or additively (this study).
To standardize for such differences, we selected a subset of species for a standardized quantitative comparison, as detailed below.

*Quantitative comparison*

We also conducted a formal comparison of our approach to conventional methods using identical tree-ring and climate data for four species: PSME (Cedar Breaks, Utah), ABAL ($\v{Z}$of$\'{i}$n), PIMA (Scotty Creek), and LITU (SCBI; Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`). 
These species were selected for analysis because they have been well-studied in the past.
For each species, we compared climate sensitivities for the top precipitation- and temperature- group variables, as identified in the main analysis. 

Prior to analysis, data were prepared and cleaned as described in the Methods section, resulting in an identical set of records for input into each analysis.
For the approach developed here, analysis was conducted as described in the Methods section, but with the *climwin* climate variable selection process limited to just the species of interest (as opposed to all species at the site), climate variables considered individually rather than additively, analysis of only first-order linear relationships, and with start date adjusted to match the conventional method (see below).
*Climwin* is a useful analytical tool that automates the process of running and comparing numerous regressions, but its use does not alter results relative to what would be obtained via a more conventional approach; numerous climate drivers and time windows can be compared without climwin (e.g., REFS), and *climwin* can also be used on residual chronologies. 
Following the *climwin* analysis step, we extracted *beta* coefficients describing the slope of the relationship between climate and $RW$.
*Beta* coefficients, along with their standard error, were obtained for each month within the analysis time frame (Table `r site_details`) and for the time window identified as optimal by *climwin*.

For the analysis using conventional methods, the ring-width series from each core was standardized via ARSTAN using a 2/3rds $n$ spline, where $n$ is the number of years in the series [@cook_time_1985; @cook_methods_1990]. 
*(The following italic text is self-plagarized from Helcoski and needs to be reworded:)* *The influence of outliers in all series was reduced using the adaptive power transformation, which also stabilises the variance over time [@cook_calculating_1997]. Next, each series was stabilised using either the average correlation between raw ring-width series (rbar) method or a 1/3rds spline method to adjust changes in variance as series replication decreased towards the earlier portion of each chronology [@jones_estimating_1997]. The 1/3rds spline method was chosen when replication in the inner portion of each chronology (c. the inner 30–50 yr of each record depending on full chronology length) dropped below three trees. Once that step was complete, a robust biweight mean chronology for each species was calculated from the ring-width indices [@cook_time_1985]. We chose to use residual chronologies because the autoregressive standardisation process in creating them removes much of the tree-level autocorrelation in growth and these chronologies would most likely contain the most conservative information on drivers of interannual growth [@cook_time_1985].*

We defined chronology start dates according to the subsample signal strength (SSS), using a cutoff of SSS = 0.80 (or 80% of the population signal).
Thus, for this analysis only, we defined chronology start dates as the year the SSS exceeded 0.80 or two years after the start of the climate record, whichever came later. 
SSS exceeded 0.80 well before the start of the 1901 start of climate records for PSME (1800s), ABAL (1700), and PIMA (1850s). For LITU, SSS reached 0.8 with 11 trees in 1919, which we used as the start date for this series.
We note that these start date criteria differ from those used in the main analysis (Table `r sampling_details_table`), which had earlier start dates because the analysis was not constrained by a need to represent the full population signal.
End dates were defined as the last full year prior to sampling (Table `r sampling_details_table`), or 2007 for CB.

*Beta* (slope) coefficients for the relationship between tree growth and the monthly climate variable were derived as in @helcoski_growing_2019:
*(SELF-PLAGIARIZED CONTENT:) Analyses of climate–growth relationships were conducted using ‘dplR’ (Bunn, 2008) and ‘bootRes’ (Zang & Biondi, 2013), which correlated functions and bootstrapped confidence intervals for the relationships between annual growth and monthly climate variables following Biondi & Waikul (2004).* 
Pearson correlations between climate variables and tree-ring chronologies were converted to linear slopes using the method of @charney_observed_2016.

Finally, we generated plots comparing month-by-month *beta* coefficients describing climate sensitivity, and also comparing *beta* coefficients for the window identified as optimal by *climwin* Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`). 

*The result is that our approach yields climate correlations with greater variance but lower standard error of slope estimates (Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`).*

We note that despite designing the analyses to be as comparable as possible, one-to-one correspondence of *beta* coefficients is not necessarily expected for several reasons.
First, although the analysis time frame is standardized between the two approaches, the relative influence of each year will generally vary between the two approaches. 
The traditional approach, which all cores into a single residual chronology with one value per year, gives equal weighting to each year.
In contrast, under the approach developed here, the number records per year will vary across the analysis time frame, generally increasing over time as the younger trees enter the analysis. 
Thus, where many younger trees are included in the analysis, the two approaches will effectively give different weights to the years included in the analysis period. 
In cases where climate-sensitivity differs between old and young trees, or where the climate and/or climate response changed substantially over the analysis time frame [e.g., at Scotty Creek; Fig. `r SC_traditional_comparison`; @sniderhan_growth_2016], this may lead to divergence of the climate sensitivities estimated by the two methods.  

Second, traditional analysis methods (using ARSTAN) were primarily designed to distill population-level variation to obtain the strongest possible climate signal for the reconstruction of past climate (**Cook & Kariustis **), not to characterize climate responses on the individual level, where variation is inherently higher. 
While conversion of Pearson correlations to linear slopes *sensu* @charney_observed_2016 approximates climate responses, it does not provide an exact slope describing the relationship between individual-level or population mean growth and climate. 
This is because standardization of variance and averaging of individual-level residuals prior to the climate analysis fundamentally alters and obfuscates individual-level responses. 

We suspect that both of these factors may underlie the tendency for the traditional method to estimate stronger climate sensitivity than the approach developed here for Scotty Creek (Fig. `r SC_traditional_comparison`), a comprehensively sampled black spruce forest (i.e., including young trees) on melting permafrost. 
We note, however, that there are no statistically significant differences in the *beta* coefficients of the two approaches at this site.

## `r changing_climate_title`

[ISSUE #25 in ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity ](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity/issues/25)

Our analysis included two sites where climate change has had pronounced effects on tree growth: Scotty Creek, NW Territories, Canada (SC) and Little Tesuque, New Mexico, USA (LT).
At SC, rapidly rising temperatures are causing melting permafrost, summer moisture stress, resulting in negative growth trends in basal area index ($BAI$) starting around 1950 and significant growth declines since 1970 in `r round(249/(249+69+127)*100, digits=0)`% of trees [@sniderhan_growth_2016].
At LT, increasingly warm drought has dramatically reduced growth [@williams_temperature_2013], resulting in many missing rings in recent years.

Problematically, correlating tree growth residuals from which climate-driven trends had been removed against the climate signal with a strong directional trend would not necessarily identify the most relevant climate drivers.

For these sites, we experimented with three approaches to identifying the most important climate drivers (1) the method described above, (2) detrending the climate variables **(AT:prewhitening?)** prior to the climwin step, and (3) splitting analyses into decades before and after 1970 [*sensu*  @sniderhan_growth_2016].
