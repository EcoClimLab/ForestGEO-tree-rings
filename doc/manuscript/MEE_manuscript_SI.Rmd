## Appendix S1. Methods for reconstruction of $DBH$

DBH can be reconstructed outside-in (based on recent $DBH$, subtracting growth recorded in tree rings) or inside-out (summing $\Delta r$ from the inside out). 
We generally gave precedence to the outside-in approach.
Specifically, when $DBH$ was taken at the time of coring,  
At some of our sites where DBH was not taken at the time of coring (*SCBI*,), DBH measurements taken before or slightly after the time of coring could be used.
(see [issue #19 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/19))
If before, ... 
If after...
For all outside-in reconstructions, if a negative $DBH$ was predicted...


In either case we need bark thickness--ideally allometries describing the relationship between DBH and bark thickness. 
This is especially critical for thick-barked species
When bark thickness data were available, we generated allometries ... 
lognormal model with intercept forced to zero: lm(bark_depth.mm ~ -1 + log(dbh_no_bark.cm+1):bark_species, data = bark)
