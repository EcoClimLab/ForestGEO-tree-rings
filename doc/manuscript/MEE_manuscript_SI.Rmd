## Appendix S1. Methods for reconstruction of $DBH$

*This is still rough/ mostly notes.*

For each core, $DBH$ can be reconstructed outside-in (based on recent $DBH$, subtracting growth recorded in tree rings) or inside-out (summing $\Delta r$ from the inside out). 
We generally gave precedence to the outside-in approach.
Specifically, when $DBH$ was taken at the time of coring,  
At some of our sites where DBH was not taken at the time of coring (*SCBI*,), DBH measurements taken before or slightly after the time of coring could be used.
(see [issue #19 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/19))
If before, ... 
If after...
For all outside-in reconstructions, if a negative $DBH$ was predicted...

When there were more than one cores for a tree, the $DBH$ reconstructions from each core were averaged to produce a single estimate of the tree's $DBH$ through time. 
When the start or end dates of the records from the cores differed, we extrapolated growth of the shorter core to match the years covered by the longer core. 
Specifically, to fill in years at the more recent end, we assumed that the average growth rate of the ten years prior to the missing records applied to the missing years. 
To fill in years at the beginning of the tree's lifespan, we likewise assumed that the ten years adjacent to the missing record applied to the missing years; however, if this yielded a negative $DBH$ estimate for the earliest year in the reconstruction, we divided the existing minimum $DBH$ by number of years missing and applied that value to each year.
We note that these reconstructed growth records were used only for the reconstruction of $DBH$ and were not included as response variables in any of our analyses.


In either case we need bark thickness--ideally allometries describing the relationship between DBH and bark thickness (Table S4). 
This is especially critical for thick-barked species.
When bark thickness data were available, we generated allometries ([issue #8 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/8))... 
lognormal model with intercept forced to zero: `lm(bark_depth.mm ~ -1 + log(dbh_no_bark.cm+1):bark_species, data = bark)`.
When bark thickness data were not available, we used published bark allometries from other sources (Table S4)

## Appendix S2.  Methods for comparing climwin results with traditional methods
(**[ISSUE #35 in ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity ](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity/issues/35)

*This is in process. For ~4 selected species (well-studied), we will build chronologies that exactly match the data used in this analysis. We'll then generate a figure like Fig. S1. We expect a pretty good match, as our results are basically consistent with previous studies at all these sites.*

## Appendix S3.  Dealing with rapidly changing climate and tree growth

[ISSUE #25 in ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity ](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity/issues/25)

Our analysis included two sites where climate change has had pronounced effects on tree growth: Scotty Creek, NW Territories, Canada (SC) and Little Tesuque, New Mexico, USA (LT).
At SC, [temperatures have increased by X $^\circ$ over X years]..., resulting in negative growth trends in basal area index ($BAI$) starting around 1950 and significant growth declines since 1970 in `r round(249/(249+69+127)*100, digits=0)`% of trees [@sniderhan_growth_2016].
At LT, *(drought has increased dramatically)*, resulting in many missing rings in recent years.

*This is in process. We will try and compare 3 methods: (1) our standard approach, (2) detrending the climate variables (#53), (3) applying the climwin step only for older records--before the most rapid climate change. We will work with SC and LT researchers to determine which makes most sense, and use that as the main approach for these sites.*
