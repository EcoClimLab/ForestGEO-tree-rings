## `r DBH_reconstruction_title`

*This is still rough/ mostly notes.*

For each core, $DBH$ can be reconstructed outside-in (based on recent $DBH$, subtracting growth recorded in tree rings) or inside-out (summing $RW$ from the inside out). 
We generally gave precedence to the outside-in approach.
Specifically, when $DBH$ was taken at the time of coring,  
At some of our sites where DBH was not taken at the time of coring (*SCBI*,), DBH measurements taken before or slightly after the time of coring could be used.
(see [issue #19 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/19))
If before, ... 
If after...
For all outside-in reconstructions, if a negative $DBH$ was predicted...

When there were more than one cores for a tree, the $DBH$ reconstructions from each core were averaged to produce a single estimate of the tree's $DBH$ through time. 
When the start or end dates of the records from the cores differed, we extrapolated growth of the shorter core to match the years covered by the longer core. 
Specifically, to fill in years at the more recent end, we assumed that the average growth rate of the ten years prior to the missing records applied to the missing years. 
To fill in years at the beginning of the tree's lifespan, we likewise assumed that the ten years adjacent to the missing record applied to the missing years; however, if this yielded a negative $DBH$ estimate for the earliest year in the reconstruction, we divided the existing minimum $DBH$ by number of years missing and applied that value to each year.
We note that these reconstructed growth records were used only for the reconstruction of $DBH$ and were not included as response variables in any of our analyses.


In either case we need bark thickness--ideally allometries describing the relationship between DBH and bark thickness (Table S4). 
This is especially critical for thick-barked species.
When bark thickness data were available, we generated allometries ([issue #8 in ForestGEO_dendro](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro/issues/8))... 
lognormal model with intercept forced to zero: `lm(bark_depth.mm ~ -1 + log(dbh_no_bark.cm+1):bark_species, data = bark)`.
When bark thickness data were not available, we used published bark allometries from other sources (Table S4)

## `r traditional_comparison_title`

To verify that our methods gave similar results to traditional methods, we conducted qualitative comparisons of our results to previous studies based on the same cores (Table `r qualitative_results_comparison`) and conducted a formal quantitative comparison for four species (Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`), as detailed below. 

*Qualitative comparison*

For all species-site combinations, we reviewed previous studies characterizing the climate sensitivity of growth using conventional methods. 
In most cases, we were able to compare with previous studies from the same sites and sets of cores. 
When these were not available, we reviewed regional-level analyses believed to be representative of the site. 

Results from previous studies were compiled alongside results from the climate-only model if this study (Table `r qualitative_results_comparison`). 
Where previous studies examined numerous climate variables or time windows [e.g., @helcoski_growing_2019], we focus on those most relevant to our findings. 

Beyond the methodological differences, original studies based on the same sets of cores varied from this one and from one another in factors including
the exact set of cores analyzed,
climate data sources,
time frame of analysis,
approaches to identifying candidate climate variables and windows (including whether this is done on a site or species level), 
methods for detrending and standardizing to build chronologies,
and whether the effects of temperature and precipitation are considered separately (original studies) or additively (this study).
To standardize for such differences, we selected a subset of species for a standardized quantitative comparison, as detailed below.

*Quantitative comparison*


*([ISSUE #35 in ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity ](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity/issues/35))*

We also conducted a formal comparison using identical tree-ring and climate data for four species: PSME (Cedar Breaks, Utah), ABAL ($\v{Z}$of$\'{i}$n), PIMA (Scotty Creek), and LITU (SCBI; Figs. `r all_traditional_comparisons`). These species were selected for analysis because they have been well-studied in the past, and there was no manipulation of study species based on analysis results. 

We compared results from an analysis using conventional methods, as detailed below, to an analysis using our method as described in the Methods section, but with the *climwin* climate variable selection process limited to just the species of interest (as opposed to all species at the site), climate variables considered individually rather than additively, and with start date adjusted to match the conventional method.

The ring-width series from each core was standardized via ARSTAN using a 2/3rds $n$ spline, where $n$ is the number of years in the series (*Cook, 1985; Cook & Kairiukstis, 1990- citations in Helcoski*). 
*(The following italic text is self-plagarized from Helcoski and needs to be reworded:)* *The influence of outliers in all series was reduced using the adaptive power transformation, which also stabilises the variance over time (Cook & Peters, 1997). Next, each series was stabilised using either the average correlation between raw ring-width series (rbar) method or a 1/ 3rds spline method to adjust changes in variance as series replication decreased towards the earlier portion of each chronology (Jones et al., 1997). The 1/3rds spline method was chosen when replication in the inner portion of each chronology (c. the inner 30–50 yr of each record depending on full chronology length) dropped below three trees. Once that step was complete, a robust biweight mean chronology for each species was calculated from the ring-width indices (Cook, 1985). We chose to use residual chronologies because the autoregressive standardisation process in creating them removes much of the tree-level autocorrelation in growth and these chronologies would most likely contain the most conservative information on drivers of interannual growth (Cook, 1985).* 

Following @helcoski_growing_2019, we defined chronology start dates according to the subsample signal strength (SSS), using a cutoff of SSS = 0.80 (or 80% of the population signal).
Thus, for this analysis only, we defined chronology start dates as the year the SSS exceeded 0.80 or two years after the start of the climate record, whichever came later. 
SSS exceeded 0.80 well before the start of the 1901 start of climate records for PSME (1800s), ABAL (1700), and PIMA (1850s). For LITU , SSS reached 0.8 with 11 trees in 1919, which we used as the start date for this series.
We note that these start date criteria differ from those used in the main analysis (Table `r sampling_details_table`), which had earlier start dates because the analysis was not constrained by a need to represent the full population signal.
End dates were defined as the last full year prior to sampling (Table `r sampling_details_table`).

## `r changing_climate_title`

[ISSUE #25 in ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity ](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-climate-sensitivity/issues/25)

Our analysis included two sites where climate change has had pronounced effects on tree growth: Scotty Creek, NW Territories, Canada (SC) and Little Tesuque, New Mexico, USA (LT).
At SC, [temperatures have increased by X $^\circ$ over X years]..., resulting in negative growth trends in basal area index ($BAI$) starting around 1950 and significant growth declines since 1970 in `r round(249/(249+69+127)*100, digits=0)`% of trees [@sniderhan_growth_2016].
At LT, *(drought has increased dramatically)*, resulting in many missing rings in recent years.

*This is in process. We will try and compare 3 methods: (1) our standard approach, (2) detrending the climate variables (#53), (3) applying the climwin step only for older records--before the most rapid climate change. We will work with SC and LT researchers to determine which makes most sense, and use that as the main approach for these sites.*
