Regarding the last comment of Paolo:
'8) The ITRDB doesn’t contain any structure for storing DBH records, but ring widths allow the reconstruction of diameter over time.'  This is only true if the tree cores reached the pith, which it is unknown unless the authors indicate it explicitly.

Some references attached, mainly for the introduction:

From Esper et al. 2008 you can select some references for the first paragraph of the introduction:  'Tree-ring data from high elevation and northern environments are the most important proxy used to reconstruct climate variability over the past millennium (e.g., Briffa, 2000; Cook et al., 2004; D’Arrigo et al., 2006; Esper et al., 2002, 2004; IPCC, 2007).'

Babst 2019. Would be useful for the discussion in line with the papers that Paolo recommended regarding the sampling bias, common in dendrochronological studies (Babst used only the ITRDB, which mainly stored chronologies from dominant trees)

Klesse 2020. The authors proposed an integrative approach to study growth trends and climate sensitivity, so it will be good to highlight the differences with your approach.

Hi again, Sorry, I forgot to answer your specific questions. Also I have attached a new version of the m.s with my comments (same ideas but I have corrected some typos, I wrote them very quickly yesterday...):

Do you agree that the selected 15-mo window in which we search for best climate variables (Table S1) is appropriate for your site? We can adjust easily, although I'd prefer to keep it close to 15 months so that its relatively standard across sites
yes
Do the selected climate variables/ windows make sense based on your knowledge of the forest? (Note that selection will remain automatic, but unexpected selections may point to a fault in the process.)
yes
Do the climate and DBH responses make sense based on your knowledge of the forest? (Again, the process is automatic, but unexpected results may point to a fault in the process.)
I think so...
Will it be okay to make your data public alongside all the other data/code behind the manuscript? (The code and results will be made public via GitHub, but I don't think there will be a problem in holding back some raw data if needed.)
yes
Would you be interested in archiving your data in the The DendroEcological Network (DEN) database (https://www.uvm.edu/femc/dendro)? DEN is a new tree-ring database that includes more ecological information (critically, DBH). We have written code to put the SCBI data in their format, and I'm in touch with the database managers, who would be happy to accept data from this project.
yes
