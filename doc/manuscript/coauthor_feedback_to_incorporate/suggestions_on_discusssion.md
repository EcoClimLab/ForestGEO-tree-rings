Alan: 

One of the main points to emphasize in the Discussion is whether this is primarily a more objective approach to produce similar results to what has been shown using more conventional methods, and the degree to which it could potentially provide new insight that would not be expected using more conventional methods. Maybe you could structure the Discussion with sub-headings like 'corroboration of insight from conventional methods' and 'new insight.' It would be useful if there are examples from the analysis in this paper that could clearly illustrate new insight that would not have been found with conventional methods. 

Camille:

Congrats for the work on the manuscript, it’s very clear and nice to read! I don’t have anything to add or change at this point. I just wrote some ideas for how I would organize the discussion (see below), but it’s pretty rough and you can disregard it if you already have a good idea of how you want to do it. You already have most of the ideas in the draft paper.
What is new about this method and how it improves the understanding of climate effect on growth
Other methods are inappropriate
Variable selection: + objective choice of ecological variables
Importance of including DBH in growth prediction and dendro models: effect > climate, interactions DBH – climate
Non-linearities
The ecological results and how they compare to previous studies
Effect of climate on growth (including which variables were selected)
Effect of DBH on growth
Limitations and perspectives
Small trees are underrepresented + consequences for estimations of plot-level productivity => need for more sampling of small trees
Detrending before climwin variable selection: loss of long-term climate signals [I don’t know what solution we can have in this case]
Other limitations I haven’t thought of?
Recommendations for future dendro studies
