Regarding autocorrelation structure of order 1, “Makes sense, any cases where AR2 or more was better? In my region it is always AR1 but thought I had read in some climates, it is more autocorrelated than ar1.”

There has been a lot of work on VPD, maybe worth mentioning the PET and VPD are closely related.

 declines at high  are presumably because trees are investing fixed C elsewhere–for example, reproduction. -- I find this very interesting and it is buried. Worth making this a bigger point?

It is therefore not surprising that tree-ring studies examining the impact of rising CO2 on long-term growth growth trends reach inconsistent conclusions (Walker et al., n.d.)-- Totally agree! In this paper, I detrended climate and growth so of course I found co2 didn’t have a big impact. I’ve been thinking about this since. Could we provide advice on how to handle this? Maybe one sentence?

Additive and interactive effects of climate and DBH (Discussion)-- One thing that strikes me in this section is that most (maybe all) the sites are 2nd growth. What would this look like in older to old growth forest where the size differences between trees are even greater? One would think that this would increase the difference but do the sensitives plateau at a certain dbh?

I think we need to be clear that certain land use histories (i.e., these are 2nd growth forests) could impact our interpretation of some of these results.

One other thing that I think could be worth discussion is the magnitude in response of extremes with climate. Correlation doesn’t do this but the polynomial curves in Fig 4. Can help get out this a little. But this is an important thing to consider when thinking about how climate sensitivity. How we define it.. interannual correlation or magnitude of response? See the following, which gets at this a little but I think this effort adds to the story.
