  abstract = {How forest growth responds to climate change will impact the global carbon cycle. The sensitivity of tree growth and thus forest productivity to climate can be inferred from tree-ring increments, but individual tree responses may differ from the overall forest response. Tree-ring data have also been used to estimate interannual variability in aboveground biomass, but a shortage of robust uncertainty estimates often limits comparisons with other measurements of the carbon cycle across variable ecological settings. Here we identify and quantify four important sources of uncertainty that affect tree-ring-based aboveground biomass estimates: subsampling, allometry, forest density (sampling), and mortality. In addition, we investigate whether transforming rings widths into biomass affects the underlying growth-climate relationships at two coniferous forests located in the Valles Caldera in northern New Mexico. Allometric and mortality sources of uncertainty contributed most (34\textendash 57 and 24\textendash 42\%, respectively) and subsampling uncertainty least (7\textendash 8\%) to the total uncertainty for cumulative biomass estimates. Subsampling uncertainty, however, was the largest source of uncertainty for year-to-year variations in biomass estimates, and its large contribution indicates that between-tree growth variability remains influential to changes in year-to-year biomass estimates for a stand. The effect of the large contribution of the subsampling uncertainty is reflected by the different climate responses of large and small trees. Yet, the average influence of climate on tree growth persisted through the biomass transformation, and the biomass growth-climate relationship is comparable to that found in traditional climate reconstruction-oriented tree-ring chronologies. Including the uncertainties in estimates of aboveground biomass will aid comparisons of biomass increment across disparate forests, as well as further the use of these data in vegetation modeling frameworks.},

  abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25~ha), all stems {$\geq$}1~cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25\textdegree S\textendash 61\textdegree N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61~\textdegree C), changes in precipitation (up to {$\pm$}30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8~g N~m-2~yr-1 and 3.1~g S~m-2~yr-1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5~km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

Understanding the mechanistic basis for such scaling relationships is key to understanding forests globally and their role in Earth's changing climate system. * Here, we evaluate theoretical predictions for the scaling of nine variables in a mixed-age temperate deciduous forest (CTFS-ForestGEO forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Virginia, USA) and compare observed scaling parameters to those from other forests world-wide. We examine fifteen species and various environmental conditions. * Structural, physiological and ecological traits of trees scaled with stem diameter in a manner that was sometimes consistent with existing theoretical predictions \textendash{} more commonly with those predicting a range of scaling values than a single universal scaling value. * Scaling relationships were variable among species, reflecting substantive ecological differences. * Scaling relationships varied considerably with environmental conditions. For instance, the scaling of sap flux density varied with atmospheric moisture demand, and herbivore browsing dramatically influenced stem abundance scaling. * Thus, stand-level, time-averaged scaling relationships (e.g., the scaling of diameter growth) are underlain by a diversity of species-level scaling relationships that can vary substantially with fluctuating environmental conditions. In order to use scaling theory to accurately characterize forest ecosystems and predict their responses to global change, it will be critical to develop a more nuanced understanding of both the forces that constrain stand-level scaling and the complexity of scaling variation across species and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Douglas-fir growth in the Pacific Northwest is thought to be water limited. However, discerning the relative influence of air temperature and plant available soil water (W) on growth is difficult because they interact with each other, with other climate factors and with the inherent seasonal timing of cambial activity. Douglas-fir growth response to air temperature and W patterns during the growing season was examined using time series regression analysis of dendrometer data collected at approximately four-week intervals from 1998 through 2009. Five study sites were located in mature forest stands along an elevation gradient from the Pacific coast to the west slope of the Cascade Mountains ({$\sim$}1200m) in Oregon, USA. Maximum daily air temperature (T) and W were similar in relative importance to tree growth at four of the five sites. W was substantially more important at one site. Growth rate increased with T to an optimum (Topt) and decreased with higher T. At the two drier sites T and W affected growth interactively in that Topt decreased with decreasing W. We conclude that both T and W affect growth and that T consistently limits growth at three of the five sites and at all sites in years with above average summer temperature. Should climate change result in hotter summers in the region as predicted by climate models, we suggest that Douglas-fir will experience progressive temperature limitation.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality is a key factor influencing forest functions and dynamics, but our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mortality and the associated changes in tree growth rates are still limited. We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84\% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1\textendash 100 years in 96\% of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade- and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.},

From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for ``filling the gaps'' for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

  abstract = {In dendroclimatology, tree-ring indices are traditionally calculated as part of the tree-ring chronology development process. This is accomplished by fitting a growth curve to the ring-width series and using it as a series of expectations for more or less well specified null conditions (uniform climate perhaps) of annual radial growth. The ratio of the actual ring widths to these expectations produces a set of dimensionless indices that can be averaged arithmetically with cross-dated indices from other trees into a mean chronology suitable for studies of climatic and environmental change. We show that tree-ring indices calculated in this manner can be systematically biased. The shape of this bias is defined by the reciprocal of the growth curve used to calculate the indices, and its magnitude depends on the proximity of the growth curve to the time axis and its intercept. The underlying cause, however, is lack of fit. To avoid this bias, residuals from the growth curve, rather than ratios, can be computed. If this is done, in conjunction with appropriate transformations to stabilize the variance, the resulting tree-ring chronology will not be biased in the way that ratios can be. This bias problem is demonstrated in an annual tree-ring chronology of bristlecone pine from Campito Mountain, which has been used previously in global change studies. We show that persistent growth increase since AD 1900 in that series is over-estimated by 23.6\% on average when ratios are used instead of residuals, depending on how the ring widths are transformed. Such bias in ratios is not always serious, as it depends on the joint behaviour of the growth curve and data, particularly near the ends of the data interval. Consequently, ratios can still be used safely in many situations. However, to avoid the possibility of ratio bias problems, we recommend that variance-stabilized residuals be used.},

  abstract = {As global temperatures rise, variation in annual climate is also changing, with unknown consequences for forest biomes. Growing forests have the ability to capture atmospheric CO2 and thereby slow rising CO2 concentrations. Forests' ongoing ability to sequester C depends on how tree communities respond to changes in climate variation. Much of what we know about tree and forest response to climate variation comes from tree-ring records. Yet typical tree-ring datasets and models do not capture the diversity of climate responses that exist within and among trees and species. We address this issue using a model that estimates individual tree response to climate variables while accounting for variation in individuals' size, age, competitive status, and spatially structured latent covariates. Our model allows for inference about variance within and among species. We quantify how variables influence aboveground biomass growth of individual trees from a representative sample of 15 northern or southern tree species growing in a transition zone between boreal and temperate biomes. Individual trees varied in their growth response to fluctuating mean annual temperature and summer moisture stress. The variation among individuals within a species was wider than mean differences among species. The effects of mean temperature and summer moisture stress interacted, such that warm years produced positive responses to summer moisture availability and cool years produced negative responses. As climate models project significant increases in annual temperatures, growth of species like Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Picea glauca will vary more in response to summer moisture stress than in the past. The magnitude of biomass growth variation in response to annual climate was 92\textendash 95\% smaller than responses to tree size and age. This means that measuring or predicting the physical structure of current and future forests could tell us more about future C dynamics than growth responses related to climate change alone.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850\textendash 2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\textdegree{} and 1.5\textdegree C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

Because these stands were separated by up to 200 km and differed in species composition, elevation, and time since establishment, the observed trends in productivity imply a response to regionwide changes in environmental factors rather than to site\textemdash specific stand dynamics. Annual production is significantly correlated with long\textemdash term variation in summer temperature and short\textemdash term variation in annual precipitation since 1983, the beginning of continuous local meteorological records.

For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901\textendash 2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May\textendash July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980\textendash 2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

  abstract = {The response of forest growth to climate variability varies along environmental gradients. A growth increase and decrease with warming is usually observed in cold-humid and warm-dry regions, respectively. However, it remains poorly known where the sign of these temperature effects switches. Here we introduce a newly developed European tree-ring network that has been specifically collected to reconstruct forest aboveground biomass increment (ABI). We quantify, how the long-term (1910-2009) inter-annual variability of ABI depends on local mean May-August temperature and test, if a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) ensemble reflects the resulting patterns. We find that sites at 8\textdegree C mean May-August temperature increase ABI on average by 5.7{$\pm$}1.3 \%, whereas sites at 20\textdegree C decrease ABI by 3.0{$\pm$}1.8 \% m-2 y-1 {$\increment^\circ$}C-1. A threshold temperature between beneficial and detrimental effects of warming and the associated increase in water demand on tree growth emerged at 15.9{$\pm$}1.4\textdegree C mean May-August temperature. Because inter-annual variability increases proportionally with mean growth rate \textendash{} i.e. the coefficient of variation stays constant \textendash{} we were able to validate these findings with a much larger tree-ring dataset that had been established following classic dendrochronological sampling schemes. While the observed climate sensitivity pattern is well reflected in the DGVM ensemble, there is a large spread of threshold temperatures between the individual models. Also, individual models disagree strongly on the magnitude of climate impact at the coldest and warmest locations, suggesting where model improvement is most needed to more accurately predict forest growth and effectively guide silvicultural practices.},

In this study, we assess the inter-annual variability (IAV) of carbon uptake using annually resolved aboveground biomass increment (ABI) estimates from 272 pseudorandomly sampled trees at a long-term monitoring plot in the dry valley of the Valais in Switzerland. Over the 1950\textendash 2011 period, the mean ABI is 86.8 g C m-2 year-1 with an IAV of {$\pm$}31 \%. The IAV is largely driven by hydrological conditions throughout the water year from previous August to current August (r SPEI = 0.56; 1st differenced r = 0.75, p {$<$} 0.001). During extremely dry years (such as 1972, 1976, 1998, and 2011), the carbon accumulation was reduced up to 63 \% from the long-term mean. Furthermore, our analysis explores possible biases of annual ABI derived from manual band dendrometers in permanent plot inventories caused by water status related changes in tree size. During the snow breakage event in March 2012 and subsequent management activities, 17 \% of the standing biomass was killed. We estimate that the remaining trees will take \textasciitilde 16 years to make up for the loss of this disturbance, assuming a similar growth rate of the remaining trees as during the previous 60 years and that a potentially drier climate and the increased water availability for the remaining trees will balance each other. We demonstrate that well-replicated, representative tree-ring datasets have a huge potential to complement shorter-term and lower-resolution forest inventory monitoring data. Integrating tree-ring and plot data allow one to gain knowledge about annual changes in forest productivity even before monitoring started and help ecosystem managers to better adapt their strategies.},

The response may vary geographically, owing to genetic adaptation to climate, and temporally, as a result of acclimation to changes in ambient temperature. Our goal was to develop a robust quantitative global model representing acclimation and adaptation of photosynthetic temperature responses. We quantified and modelled key mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic temperature acclimation and adaptation using a global dataset of photosynthetic CO2 response curves, including data from 141 C3 species from tropical rainforest to Arctic tundra. We separated temperature acclimation and adaptation processes by considering seasonal and common-garden datasets, respectively. The observed global variation in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis was primarily explained by biochemical limitations to photosynthesis, rather than stomatal conductance or respiration. We found acclimation to growth temperature to be a stronger driver of this variation than adaptation to temperature at climate of origin. We developed a summary model to represent photosynthetic temperature responses and showed that it predicted the observed global variation in optimal temperatures with high accuracy. This novel algorithm should enable improved prediction of the function of global ecosystems in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Several important environmental influences of tree growth and carbon sequestration have changed over the past several decades in eastern North America, specifically, more frequent pluvial conditions, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and decreased acidic deposition. These factors could lead to changes in the relationship between tree growth and water availability, and perhaps even decouple the two, having large implications on how future climate change will impact forest productivity and carbon sequestration. Here, we examine the concurrent influence of the climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration), CO2 concentrations, and sulfate and nitrogen deposition on radial tree growth, carbon isotopes, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) for several hardwood tree species in the Midwestern United States. We found that when considering the simultaneous influence of these factors, the climatic water balance is the dominant influence on annual growth. Therefore, the recent pluvial period is the primary cause of the weakening relationship between radial growth and water availability. Even during pluvial periods, water availability is the primary control on growth, with increasing CO2 concentrations and decreased SO4 deposition being secondary factors. Importantly, the weakening in the climate-growth relationship is species specific, with Acer species having stable relationships with the climatic water balance, Liriodendron tulipifera showing a strengthening relationship, and Quercus species and Populus grandidentata exhibiting weakening. Thus, interannual variations in soil moisture unevenly impact tree growth and carbon sequestration. Our findings suggest that, despite recent pluvial conditions, increasing CO2 concentrations and decreasing acidic deposition have not buffered the impact of water availability on tree growth and carbon sequestration.},

Tree rings have long provided historical context of hydroclimate variability of the U.S. However, the tree-ring network used to create these countrywide gridded reconstructions is sparse in certain locations, such as the Midwest. Here, we increase (n~=~20) the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network in southern Indiana and compare a summer (June\textendash August) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruction to existing gridded reconstructions of PDSI for this region. We find both droughts and pluvials that were previously unknown that rival the most intense PDSI values during the instrumental period. Additionally, historical drought occurred in Indiana that eclipsed instrumental conditions with regard to severity and duration. During the period 1962\textendash 2004 CE, we find that teleconnections of drought conditions through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation have a strong influence (r~=~-0.60, p~{$<~$}0.01) on secondary tree growth in this region for the late spring-early summer season. These findings highlight the importance of continuing to increase the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network used to infer past climate dynamics to capture the sub-regional spatial variability. Increasing the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network for a given region can better identify sub-regional variability, improve the accuracy of regional tree-ring PDSI reconstructions, and provide better information for climatic teleconnections.},

  abstract = {Shifting forest dynamics Forest dynamics are the processes of recruitment, growth, death, and turnover of the constituent tree species of the forest community. These processes are driven by disturbances both natural and anthropogenic. McDowell et al. review recent progress in understanding the drivers of forest dynamics and how these are interacting and changing in the context of global climate change. The authors show that shifts in forest dynamics are already occurring, and the emerging pattern is that global forests are tending toward younger stands with faster turnover as old-growth forest with stable dynamics are dwindling. Science, this issue p. eaaz9463 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDForest dynamics arise from the interplay of chronic drivers and transient disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality. The resulting trajectories of vegetation development drive the biomass and species composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Forest dynamics are changing because of anthropogenic-driven exacerbation of chronic drivers, such as rising temperature and CO2, and increasing transient disturbances, including wildfire, drought, windthrow, biotic attack, and land-use change. There are widespread observations of increasing tree mortality due to changing climate and land use, as well as observations of growth stimulation of younger forests due to CO2 fertilization. These antagonistic processes are co-occurring globally, leaving the fate of future forests uncertain. We examine the implications of changing forest demography and its drivers for both future forest management and forecasting impacts of global climate forcing. ADVANCESWe reviewed the literature of forest demographic responses to chronic drivers and transient disturbances to generate hypotheses on future trajectories of these factors and their subsequent impacts on vegetation dynamics, with a focus on forested ecosystems. We complemented this review with analyses of global land-use change and disturbance datasets to independently evaluate the implications of changing drivers and disturbances on global-scale tree demographics. Ongoing changes in environmental drivers and disturbance regimes are consistently increasing mortality and forcing forests toward shorter-statured and younger stands, reducing potential carbon storage. Acclimation, adaptation, and migration may partially mitigate these effects. These increased forest impacts are due to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, windthrow, insect or pathogen outbreaks) and land-use change, both of which are predicted to increase in magnitude in the future. Atmospherically derived estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink and remote sensing data indicate that tree growth and potentially recruitment may have increased globally in the 20th century, but the growth of this carbon sink has slowed. Variability in growth stimulation due to CO2 fertilization is evident globally, with observations and experiments suggesting that forests benefit from CO2 primarily in early stages of secondary succession. Furthermore, increased tree growth typically requires sufficient water and nutrients to take advantage of rising CO2. Collectively, the evidence reveals that it is highly likely that tree mortality rates will continue to increase, whereas recruitment and growth will respond to changing drivers in a spatially and temporally variable manner. The net impact will be a reduction in forest canopy cover and biomass. OUTLOOKPervasive shifts in forest vegetation dynamics are already occurring and are likely to accelerate under future global changes, with consequences for biodiversity and climate forcing. This conclusion is robust with respect to the abundant literature evidence and our global assessment of historical demographic changes, but it also forms the basis for hypotheses regarding the patterns and processes underlying the shifts in forest dynamics. These hypotheses will be directly testable using emerging terrestrial and satellite-based observation networks. The existing evidence and newly made observations provide a critical test of Earth system models that continue to improve in their ability to simulate forest dynamics and resulting climate forcing. Ultimately, forest managers and natural resource policies must confront the consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes to ensure sustainable forests and accrue their associated benefits. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6494/eaaz9463/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A conceptual diagram of the components of forest dynamics and the disturbances that drive them.In the far-left panel, a mature ecosystem is responsive primarily to localized mortality, and the primary drivers of demography are chronically changing variables such as CO2, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In the next panel, the system is disturbed by fire, insect outbreak, or another large-scale perturbation that removes most of the overstory trees, and species adapted to rapid postdisturbance recruitment become established. In the third panel, recruitment and growth dominate demographic processes, with mortality increasing over time as competition leads to self-thinning. In the last panel, a mature ecosystem is dominated by species that have replaced the original community in response to chronic environmental changes, leading to a novel ecosystem. Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances.},

As demographic rates are important to estimates of carbon fluxes in forests, this theory might offer important insights into the global carbon budget, and deserves careful assessment. We assembled data from 10 old-growth tropical forests encompassing censuses of 367 ha and {$>$} 1.7 million trees to test the theory's predictions. We also developed a set of alternative predictions that retained some assumptions of metabolic ecology while also considering how availability of a key limiting resource, light, changes with tree size. Our results show that there are no universal scaling relationships of growth or mortality with size among trees in tropical forests. Observed patterns were consistent with our alternative model in the one site where we had the data necessary to evaluate it, and were inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology in all forests.},

  abstract = {Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB), or carbon (AGC), in tropical forests has become a major concern for scientists and stakeholders. However, AGB assessment procedures are not fully standardized and even more importantly, the uncertainty associated with AGB estimates is seldom assessed. Here, we present an r package designed to compute both AGB/AGC estimate and its associated uncertainty from forest plot datasets, using a Bayesian inference procedure. The package builds upon previous work on pantropical and regional biomass allometric equations and published datasets by default, but it can also integrate unpublished or complementary datasets in many steps. BIOMASS performs a number of standard tasks on input forest tree inventories: (i) tree species identification, if available, is automatically corrected; (ii) wood density is estimated from tree species identity; (iii) if height data are available, a local height\textendash diameter allometry may be built; else height is inferred from pantropical or regional models; (iv) finally, AGB/AGC are estimated by propagating the errors associated with all the calculation steps up to the final estimate. R code is given in the paper and in the appendix for the purpose of illustration. The BIOMASS package should contribute to improved standards for AGB calculation for tropical forest stands, and will encourage users to report the uncertainties associated with stand-level AGB/AGC estimates in future studies.},

What is the disturbance history of the natural forest? How do we understand the influence of the Kyrill storm, which affected the reserve on 18 January 2007? How does the disturbance history in dendrochronological records correspond to real disturbances? Location \v{Z}of\'insk\'y Prales (48 \textdegree 40{${'}$} N, 14 \textdegree 42{${'}$} E, 735\textendash 830 m a.s.l., granite, Czech Republic) Methods Repeated tree-censuses ({$>$}20 000 trees) were carried out in 1975, 1997 and 2008. These surveys served as the basis of dendrochronological research, during which 3 020 trees were sampled. A boundary line (BL) approach and geostatistical techniques were used to detect disturbance intensity and its spatial pattern. Results The mean disturbance rate was 11.0\% canopy loss per decade (maximum 33.7\%) in the core zone. Bordering forests were directly affected by humans after 1800. A maximum of nine disturbance events were recorded per tree, but there were also 3\% of non-suppressed trees without records of disturbance events. The Kyrill storm represented a singular event in the forest history from the point of view of its exceptional spatial pattern (ranges up to 320.0 m), but not from the perspective of disturbance intensity. The relationship between disturbance intensity (y) and the range of spatial autocorrelation (x) can be explained by the equation y = 10.6863 + 0.0783*x (R2 = 0.546, P = 0.009). The spatial variability of releases {$\geq$}50\% of BL corresponds to real disturbance events, while the insertion of weak releases led to the overestimation of range. The frequency of releases was affected by a decrease in air pollution at the beginning of the 1990s. Conclusions Effects of small-scale disturbances predominate in forest dynamics. Disturbance intensity was often not directly in accordance with the range of spatial autocorrelation. The ecological role of disturbance is therefore biased if disturbance intensity is used as the sole criterion. The results suggest the importance of historical and geographical contingency in ecosystem development.},

  abstract = {Tree growth estimation is a challenging task as difficulties associated with data collection and inference often result in inaccurate estimates. Two main methods for tree growth estimation are diameter tape measurements and increment cores. The former involves repeatedly measuring tree diameters with a cloth or metal tape whose scale has been adjusted to give diameter readings directly. This approach has the advantage that diameters can be measured rapidly. However, because of the substantial error involved during tape measurements, negative diameter increments are often observed. Alternatively, annual radius increment data can be obtained by taking tree cores and averaging repeated measurements of the ring widths. Acquiring and analyzing tree cores is a time-consuming process, and taking multiple cores may have adverse effects on tree health. Therefore, radius increment data are typically only available for a subset of trees within a stand. We offer a fusion of the data sources, which enables us to accommodate missingness and to borrow strength across individuals. It enables individual tree-level inference as well as average or stand level inference. Our model recognizes that tree growth in a given year depends upon tree size at the start of the year as well as levels of appropriate covariates operating in that year. We apply our modeling to a fairly large dataset taken from two forest stands at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachians collected from 1991 to 2011.

We highlight challenges and pitfalls that influence such interpretations. The ability to observe and calibrate biomass change in large stems requires adequate data regarding these specific stems. Data checking and control procedures can bias estimates of biomass growth and generate false increases with stem size. It is important to distinguish aggregate and individual-level trends: a failure to do so results in flawed interpretations. Our assessment of biomass growth in 706 tropical forest stems indicates that individual biomass growth patterns often plateau for extended periods, with no significant difference in the number of stems indicating positive and negative trends in all but one of the 14 species. Nonetheless, when comparing aggregate growth during the most recent five years, 13 out of our 14 species indicate that biomass growth increases with size even among the largest sizes. Thus, individual and aggregate patterns of biomass growth with size are distinct. Claims concerning general biomass growth patterns for large trees remain unconvincing. We suggest how future studies can improve our knowledge of growth patterns in and among large trees. A lay summary is available for this article.},

  abstract = {Key message\hspace{0.6em} Changes in tree's climate sensitivity during their ontogenetic development is best assessed with stem diameter classes, which can be calculated retrospectively from the cumulative ring width. Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Climate affects tree growth but the effect size can be modulated by other variables, including tree's age and size. To assess how climate sensitivity changes over the life of a tree, previous studies mostly stratified trees into age classes, while cambial ring-age stratification (age-band decomposition) was less frequently used. However, trees do not age as other organisms and arguably age is mainly a proxy for size, which in contrast to age has been shown to affect wood anatomy and physiology. Stem diameter classes, calculated from cumulative ring width, could thus facilitate a more direct assessment of size effects. Here we compare these three methods, which differ regarding how they stratify data into age/size classes. We found that using age-band decomposition and cumulative ring-width classes had major advantages over the tree-age method: (a) age and size are decoupled from other temporal changes, like atmospheric C\- O2 concentration or nitrogen deposition, which excludes potential biases. (b) Shifts in climate sensitivity occur earlier than estimated by the tree-age method. (c) Younger/smaller classes can be assessed. Furthermore, direct comparison supports that size, rather than age, alters climate sensitivity. Therefore, the cumulative ring-width method appears to be the best approach to assess the effect of ontogenetic changes on a tree's climate sensitivity. Understanding how climate sensitivity changes when trees get older and larger is important for forest ecology and management, climate reconstructions, global carbon models and can help to study age and height limitations of trees.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is increasing, which increases leaf-scale photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency. These direct responses have the potential to increase plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sink would slow the rate of [CO2] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO2-responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global change and evidence for a [CO2]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here we synthesise theory and broad, multi-disciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO2] (iCO2) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in global photosynthesis since pre-industry. Established theory, supported by experiments, indicates that iCO2 is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting, atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparent iCO2-responses are high in comparison with experiments and theory. Plant mortality and soil carbon iCO2-responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidence supports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO2, albeit with uncertain magnitude and strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring records provide global high-resolution information on tree-species responses to global change, forest carbon and water dynamics, and past climate variability and extremes. The underlying assumption is a stationary (time-stable), quasi-linear relationship between tree growth and environment, which however conflicts with basic ecological and evolutionary theory. Indeed, our global assessment of the relevant tree-ring literature demonstrates non-stationarity in the majority of tested cases, not limited to specific proxies, environmental parameters, regions or species. Non-stationarity likely represents the general nature of the relationship between tree-growth proxies and environment. Studies assuming stationarity however score two times more citations influencing other fields of science and the science\textendash policy interface. To reconcile ecological reality with the application of tree-ring proxies for climate or environmental estimates, we provide a clarification of the stationarity concept, propose a simple confidence framework for the re-evaluation of existing studies and recommend the use of a new statistical tool to detect non-stationarity in tree-ring proxies. Our contribution is meant to stimulate and facilitate discussion in light of our results to help increase confidence in tree-ring-based climate and environmental estimates for science, the public and policymakers.},
