  abstract = {Tree-ring reconstructions of temperature often target trees at altitudinal or latitudinal tree line where annual growth is broadly expected to be limited by and respond to temperature variability. Based on this principal, regions with sparse tree line would seem to be restricted in their potential to reconstruct past temperatures. In the northeastern United States, there are only two published temperature reconstructions. Previous work in the region reconstructing moisture availability, however, has shown that using a greater diversity of species can improve reconstruction model skill. Here, we use a network of 228 tree-ring records composed of 29 species to test the hypothesis that an increase in species diversity among the pool of predictors improves reconstructions of past temperatures. Chamaecyparis thyoides alone explained 31\% of the variability in observed cool-season minimum temperatures, but a multispecies model increased the explained variance to 44\%. Liriodendron tulipifera, a species not previously used for temperature reconstructions, explained a similar amount of variance as Chamaecyparis thyoides (12.9\% and 20.8\%, respectively). Increasing the species diversity of tree proxies has the potential for improving reconstruction of paleotemperatures in regions lacking latitudinal or elevational tree lines provided that long-lived hardwood records can be located.},

  abstract = {How forest growth responds to climate change will impact the global carbon cycle. The sensitivity of tree growth and thus forest productivity to climate can be inferred from tree-ring increments, but individual tree responses may differ from the overall forest response. Tree-ring data have also been used to estimate interannual variability in aboveground biomass, but a shortage of robust uncertainty estimates often limits comparisons with other measurements of the carbon cycle across variable ecological settings. Here we identify and quantify four important sources of uncertainty that affect tree-ring-based aboveground biomass estimates: subsampling, allometry, forest density (sampling), and mortality. In addition, we investigate whether transforming rings widths into biomass affects the underlying growth-climate relationships at two coniferous forests located in the Valles Caldera in northern New Mexico. Allometric and mortality sources of uncertainty contributed most (34\textendash 57 and 24\textendash 42\%, respectively) and subsampling uncertainty least (7\textendash 8\%) to the total uncertainty for cumulative biomass estimates. Subsampling uncertainty, however, was the largest source of uncertainty for year-to-year variations in biomass estimates, and its large contribution indicates that between-tree growth variability remains influential to changes in year-to-year biomass estimates for a stand. The effect of the large contribution of the subsampling uncertainty is reflected by the different climate responses of large and small trees. Yet, the average influence of climate on tree growth persisted through the biomass transformation, and the biomass growth-climate relationship is comparable to that found in traditional climate reconstruction-oriented tree-ring chronologies. Including the uncertainties in estimates of aboveground biomass will aid comparisons of biomass increment across disparate forests, as well as further the use of these data in vegetation modeling frameworks.},

  abstract = {Europe is undergoing significant forest expansion due to the abandonment of rural areas driven by economic and demographic changes. Recently established forests provide key ecosystem services such as habitat provision and increased carbon stocks. However, we lack understanding of whether past land use might alter their resilience to climate change compared with long-established forests. Forests established in former agricultural areas may benefit from land use legacies resulting in higher fertility, yet such a benefit might turn into a disadvantage if it involves changes in functional attributes that lower their ability to cope with negative climatic events (e.g. droughts). Here we examined whether recently (post 1956) and long-established (pre 1956) beech forests in Catalonia (NE Spain) differ in their growth patterns, wood density, sensitivity to climate and response to extreme climatic events. Our results indicate higher growth (32\%) and lower wood density (3\%) in trees from recently established forests, even when controlling for tree age and competition. In addition, recently established forests showed a higher sensitivity to Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), precipitation and temperature and to extreme negative and positive climatic events. In particularly wet years, recently established forests show twice the number of positive pointer years than long-established forests. Compensatory growth during positive years in recently established forests, may be driving the similar or even higher recovery and resilience detected after drought episodes. Nevertheless, the higher climatic sensitivity of the recently established forests, together with their greater growth and lower wood density indicates that they may be particularly vulnerable to future droughts. Such enhanced vulnerability might question their ability to contribute to carbon sequestration in the long term and emphasises the need to account for land use legacies to better predict future forest function as climate changes.},

  abstract = {Global change is impacting forests worldwide, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services including climate regulation. Understanding how forests respond is critical to forest conservation and climate protection. This review describes an international network of 59 long-term forest dynamics research sites (CTFS-ForestGEO) useful for characterizing forest responses to global change. Within very large plots (median size 25~ha), all stems {$\geq$}1~cm diameter are identified to species, mapped, and regularly recensused according to standardized protocols. CTFS-ForestGEO spans 25\textdegree S\textendash 61\textdegree N latitude, is generally representative of the range of bioclimatic, edaphic, and topographic conditions experienced by forests worldwide, and is the only forest monitoring network that applies a standardized protocol to each of the world's major forest biomes. Supplementary standardized measurements at subsets of the sites provide additional information on plants, animals, and ecosystem and environmental variables. CTFS-ForestGEO sites are experiencing multifaceted anthropogenic global change pressures including warming (average 0.61~\textdegree C), changes in precipitation (up to {$\pm$}30\% change), atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds (up to 3.8~g N~m-2~yr-1 and 3.1~g S~m-2~yr-1), and forest fragmentation in the surrounding landscape (up to 88\% reduced tree cover within 5~km). The broad suite of measurements made at CTFS-ForestGEO sites makes it possible to investigate the complex ways in which global change is impacting forest dynamics. Ongoing research across the CTFS-ForestGEO network is yielding insights into how and why the forests are changing, and continued monitoring will provide vital contributions to understanding worldwide forest diversity and dynamics in an era of global change.},

Understanding the mechanistic basis for such scaling relationships is key to understanding forests globally and their role in Earth's changing climate system. * Here, we evaluate theoretical predictions for the scaling of nine variables in a mixed-age temperate deciduous forest (CTFS-ForestGEO forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Virginia, USA) and compare observed scaling parameters to those from other forests world-wide. We examine fifteen species and various environmental conditions. * Structural, physiological and ecological traits of trees scaled with stem diameter in a manner that was sometimes consistent with existing theoretical predictions \textendash{} more commonly with those predicting a range of scaling values than a single universal scaling value. * Scaling relationships were variable among species, reflecting substantive ecological differences. * Scaling relationships varied considerably with environmental conditions. For instance, the scaling of sap flux density varied with atmospheric moisture demand, and herbivore browsing dramatically influenced stem abundance scaling. * Thus, stand-level, time-averaged scaling relationships (e.g., the scaling of diameter growth) are underlain by a diversity of species-level scaling relationships that can vary substantially with fluctuating environmental conditions. In order to use scaling theory to accurately characterize forest ecosystems and predict their responses to global change, it will be critical to develop a more nuanced understanding of both the forces that constrain stand-level scaling and the complexity of scaling variation across species and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Results from the fully and biogeochemically coupled simulations in which CO2 increases at a rate of 1\,\%\,yr-1 (1pctCO2) from its preindustrial value are analyzed to quantify the magnitude of carbon\textendash concentration and carbon\textendash climate feedback parameters which measure the response of ocean and terrestrial carbon pools to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the resulting change in global climate, respectively. The results are based on 11 comprehensive Earth system models from the most recent (sixth) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and compared with eight models from the fifth CMIP (CMIP5). The strength of the carbon\textendash concentration feedback is of comparable magnitudes over land (mean\,{$\pm$}\,standard deviation\,=\,0.97\,{$\pm$}\,0.40\,PgC\,ppm-1) and ocean (0.79\,{$\pm$}\,0.07\,PgC\,ppm-1), while the carbon\textendash climate feedback over land (-45.1\,{$\pm$}\,50.6\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1) is about 3 times larger than over ocean (-17.2\,{$\pm$}\,5.0\,PgC\,{$\circ$}C-1). The strength of both feedbacks is an order of magnitude more uncertain over land than over ocean as has been seen in existing studies. These values and their spread from 11 CMIP6 models have not changed significantly compared to CMIP5 models. The absolute values of feedback parameters are lower for land with models that include a representation of nitrogen cycle. The transient climate response to cumulative emissions (TCRE) from the 11 CMIP6 models considered here is 1.77\,{$\pm$}\,0.37\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1 and is similar to that found in CMIP5 models (1.63\,{$\pm$}\,0.48\,{$\circ$}C\,EgC-1) but with somewhat reduced model spread. The expressions for feedback parameters based on the fully and biogeochemically coupled configurations of the 1pctCO2 simulation are simplified when the small temperature change in the biogeochemically coupled simulation is ignored. Decomposition of the terms of these simplified expressions for the feedback parameters is used to gain insight into the reasons for differing responses among ocean and land carbon cycle models.},

In many parts of the eastern United States (US), more xeric-adapted oak-hickory dominated stands are being replaced with mesic beech-maple assemblages. To examine the possible impacts of this ongoing change in forest composition, we investigated how two wide-ranging and co-occurring eastern US species \textendash{} Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Quercus alba (white oak) \textendash{} respond to interannual climate variability. Using 781 tree cores from 418 individual trees at 18 locations, we found late-growing season drought reduced A. saccharum growth more than that of Q. alba. A gradient in the growth reduction across latitude was also found in A. saccharum, where southern populations of A. saccharum experienced greater reductions in growth during drought. Drought had a legacy effect on growth for both species, with drought occurring later in the growing season having a larger legacy effect. Consequently, as forests shift from oak to maple dominance, drought in the later part of the growing season is likely to become an increasingly important control on forest productivity. Thus, our findings suggest that co-occurring species are responding to environmental conditions during different times in the growing season and, therefore, the timing of drought conditions will play an important role in forest productivity and carbon sequestration as forest species composition changes. These findings are particularly important because the projected increases in potential evapotranspiration, combined with possible changes in the seasonality of precipitation could have a substantial impact on how tree growth responds to future climatic change.},

We quantify tree vigor at the individual tree level, based on the difference between expected and observed growth. The available methods to join nonlinear tree growth and mortality processes are not commonly used by forest ecologists so that we develop an inference methodology based on an MCMC approach, allowing us to sample the parameters of the growth and mortality model according to their posterior distribution using the joint model likelihood. We apply our framework to a set of data on the 20-year dynamics of a forest in Paracou, French Guiana, taking advantage of functional trait-based growth and mortality models already developed independently. Our results showed that growth and mortality are intimately linked and that the vigor estimator is an essential predictor of mortality, highlighting that trees growing more than expected have a far lower probability of dying. Our joint model methodology is sufficiently generic to be used to join two longitudinal and punctual linked processes and thus may be applied to a wide range of growth and mortality models. In the context of global changes, such joint models are urgently needed in tropical forests to analyze, and then predict, the effects of the ongoing changes on the tree dynamics in hyperdiverse tropical forests.},

By assessing and statistically scaling the climatic drivers from 2710 tree-ring sites, we identified the boreal and temperate land areas where tree growth during 1930\textendash 1960 CE responded positively to temperature (20.8 {$\pm$} 3.7 Mio km2; 25.9 {$\pm$} 4.6\%), precipitation (77.5 {$\pm$} 3.3 Mio km2; 96.4 {$\pm$} 4.1\%), and other parameters. The spatial manifestation of this climate response is determined by latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradients, indicating that warming leads to geographic shifts in growth limitations. We observed a significant (P {$<$} 0.001) decrease in temperature response at cold-dry sites between 1930\textendash 1960 and 1960\textendash 1990 CE, and the total temperature-limited area shrunk by -8.7 {$\pm$} 0.6 Mio km2. Simultaneously, trees became more limited by atmospheric water demand almost worldwide. These changes occurred under mild warming, and we expect that continued climate change will trigger a major redistribution in growth responses to climate.

  abstract = {Disturbances influence forest dynamics across a range of spatial and temporal scales. In tropical forests most studies have focused on disturbances occurring at small spatial and temporal scales (i.e., gap dynamics). This is primarily due to the difficulty of reconstructing long-term disturbance histories of forests in which most tree species lack annual growth rings. Consequently, the role of past disturbances in tropical forests is poorly understood. We used a combination of direct and indirect methods to reconstruct the historical disturbance regime and stand development patterns in mature and regenerating seasonal dry evergreen forest (SDEF) in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand. Direct estimates of long-term establishment and growth patterns were obtained from 12 tree species that form annual growth rings as a consequence of the region's strong intra-annual rainfall seasonality. Indirect estimates of establishment patterns were obtained from analyses of stand structure and individual tree architecture and application of age-estimation models to 10 dominant canopy-tree species using demographic data from a large-scale, permanent forest-dynamics plot. The combination of direct and indirect methodologies revealed a complex disturbance history in the seasonal evergreen forest over the past 250 years. In the mid-1800s, 200\textendash 300 ha of forest were destroyed by a catastrophic disturbance, which led to the synchronous establishment of many of the trees that presently dominate the forest canopy. Since then widespread disturbances of variable intensity have occurred at least three times (1910s, 1940s, and 1960s). These disturbances created discrete temporal pulses of establishment in small to large gaps in the forest matrix across several square kilometers. Background mortality and gap formation were evident in every decade since 1790, but these varied in intensity and frequency. The SDEF retains a distinct structural and floristic legacy from the catastrophic disturbance of the mid-1800s. The single-age cohort that established after the disturbance has developed a complex three-dimensional structure as a consequence of differences in interspecific growth patterns of the canopy-tree species and subsequent disturbances of moderate and low intensity. While no single methodological approach provided a complete picture of the disturbance history and stand development patterns of the seasonal evergreen forest, taken together they offered new insights into the long-term dynamics of a primary tropical forest. In particular, the study highlighted the role of disturbance at multiple spatial and temporal scales and varying intensities in determining the structure and composition of a complex, species-rich tropical forest and raises important questions about the role of rare, catastrophic events on tropical forest dynamics.},

  abstract = {Douglas-fir growth in the Pacific Northwest is thought to be water limited. However, discerning the relative influence of air temperature and plant available soil water (W) on growth is difficult because they interact with each other, with other climate factors and with the inherent seasonal timing of cambial activity. Douglas-fir growth response to air temperature and W patterns during the growing season was examined using time series regression analysis of dendrometer data collected at approximately four-week intervals from 1998 through 2009. Five study sites were located in mature forest stands along an elevation gradient from the Pacific coast to the west slope of the Cascade Mountains ({$\sim$}1200m) in Oregon, USA. Maximum daily air temperature (T) and W were similar in relative importance to tree growth at four of the five sites. W was substantially more important at one site. Growth rate increased with T to an optimum (Topt) and decreased with higher T. At the two drier sites T and W affected growth interactively in that Topt decreased with decreasing W. We conclude that both T and W affect growth and that T consistently limits growth at three of the five sites and at all sites in years with above average summer temperature. Should climate change result in hotter summers in the region as predicted by climate models, we suggest that Douglas-fir will experience progressive temperature limitation.},

  abstract = {Increasing water-use efficiency (WUE), the ratio of carbon gain to water loss, is a key mechanism that enhances carbon uptake by terrestrial vegetation under rising atmospheric CO2 (ca). Existing theory and empirical evidence suggest a proportional WUE increase in response to rising ca as plants maintain a relatively constant ratio between the leaf intercellular (ci) and ambient (ca) partial CO2 pressure (ci/ca). This has been hypothesized as the main driver of the strengthening of the terrestrial carbon sink over the recent decades. However, proportionality may not characterize CO2 effects on WUE on longer time-scales and the role of climate in modulating these effects is uncertain. Here, we evaluate long-term WUE responses to ca and climate from 1901 to 2012 CE by reconstructing intrinsic WUE (iWUE, the ratio of photosynthesis to stomatal conductance) using carbon isotopes in tree rings across temperate forests in the northeastern USA. We show that iWUE increased steadily from 1901 to 1975 CE but remained constant thereafter despite continuously rising ca. This finding is consistent with a passive physiological response to ca and coincides with a shift to significantly wetter conditions across the region. Tree physiology was driven by summer moisture at multi-decadal time-scales and did not maintain a constant ci/ca in response to rising ca indicating that a point was reached where rising CO2 had a diminishing effect on tree iWUE. Our results challenge the mechanism, magnitude, and persistence of CO2's effect on iWUE with significant implications for projections of terrestrial productivity under a changing climate.},

  abstract = {A tree's radial growth sequence can be thought of as an aggregate of different growth components such as age and size limitations, presence or absence of disturbance events, continuous impact of climate variability and variance induced by unknown origin. The potentially very complex growth patterns with prominent temporal and spatial variability imply that our understanding of climate-vegetation feedbacks essentially benefits from the expansion of large tree ring networks into data-poor regions, and our ability to disentangle growth constraints by comparing ring series at multiple scales. In this study, we analyze Central-Eastern Europe's most substantial assemblage of primary Norway spruce forests found in the Carpathian arc. The vast data set, {$>$}10,000 tree-ring series, is stratified along a prominent gradient in climate response space over four separate landscapes. We integrated curve intervention detection and dendroclimatic standardization to decompose tree growth variance into climatic, disturbance and residual components to explore the behavior of the components over increasingly larger spatial hierarchies. We show that the residual variance of unknown origin is the most prominent variance in individual Carpathian spruce trees, but at larger spatial hierarchies, climate variance dominates. The variance induced by climate was further explored with common correlation analyses, growth response to extreme climate years and forward modeling of tree growth to identify leading modes of climate response, and potentially non-linear and mixed climate response patterns. We find that the climatic response of the different forest landscapes overall can be described as an asymptotic response to June and July temperatures, most likely intermixed with influence from winter precipitation. In the collection of landscapes, Southern Romania stands out as being the least temperature sensitive and most likely exhibiting the most complicated mixed temperature and moisture limitation.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality is a key factor influencing forest functions and dynamics, but our understanding of the mechanisms leading to mortality and the associated changes in tree growth rates are still limited. We compiled a new pan-continental tree-ring width database from sites where both dead and living trees were sampled (2970 dead and 4224 living trees from 190 sites, including 36 species), and compared early and recent growth rates between trees that died and those that survived a given mortality event. We observed a decrease in radial growth before death in ca. 84\% of the mortality events. The extent and duration of these reductions were highly variable (1\textendash 100 years in 96\% of events) due to the complex interactions among study species and the source(s) of mortality. Strong and long-lasting declines were found for gymnosperms, shade- and drought-tolerant species, and trees that died from competition. Angiosperms and trees that died due to biotic attacks (especially bark-beetles) typically showed relatively small and short-term growth reductions. Our analysis did not highlight any universal trade-off between early growth and tree longevity within a species, although this result may also reflect high variability in sampling design among sites. The intersite and interspecific variability in growth patterns before mortality provides valuable information on the nature of the mortality process, which is consistent with our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to mortality. Abrupt changes in growth immediately before death can be associated with generalized hydraulic failure and/or bark-beetle attack, while long-term decrease in growth may be associated with a gradual decline in hydraulic performance coupled with depletion in carbon reserves. Our results imply that growth-based mortality algorithms may be a powerful tool for predicting gymnosperm mortality induced by chronic stress, but not necessarily so for angiosperms and in case of intense drought or bark-beetle outbreaks.},

  abstract = {The development of dendrochronological time series in order to analyze climate-growth relationships usually involves first a rigorous selection of trees and then the computation of the mean tree-growth measurement series. This study suggests a change in the perspective, passing from an analysis of climate-growth relationships that typically focuses on the mean response of a species to investigating the whole range of individual responses among sample trees. Results highlight that this new approach, tested on a larch and stone pine tree-ring dataset, outperforms, in terms of information obtained, the classical one, with significant improvements regarding the strength, distribution and time-variability of the individual tree-ring growth response to climate. Moreover, a significant change over time of the tree sensitivity to climatic variability has been detected. Accordingly, the best-responder trees at any one time may not always have been the best-responders and may not continue to be so. With minor adjustments to current dendroecological protocol and adopting an individualistic approach, we can improve the quality and reliability of the ecological inferences derived from the climate-growth relationships.},

  abstract = {Biogeographical and ecological theory suggests that species distributions should be driven to higher altitudes and latitudes as global temperatures rise. Such changes occur as growth improves at the poleward edge of a species distribution and declines at the range edge in the opposite or equatorial direction, mirrored by changes in the establishment of new individuals. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that such processes are underway for a wide variety of species. Case studies from populations at the equatorial range edge of a variety of woody species have led us to understand that widespread growth decline and distributional shifts are underway. However, in apparent contrast, other studies report high productivity and reproduction in some range edge populations. We sought to assess temporal trends in the growth of the widespread European beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) across its latitudinal range. We explored the stability of populations to major drought events and the implications for predicted widespread growth decline at its equatorial range edge. In contrast to expectations, we found greatest sensitivity and low resistance to drought in the core of the species range, whilst dry range edge populations showed particularly high resistance to drought and little evidence of drought-linked growth decline. We hypothesize that this high range edge resistance to drought is driven primarily by local environmental factors that allow relict populations to persist despite regionally unfavourable climate. The persistence of such populations demonstrates that range-edge decline is not ubiquitous and is likely to be driven by declining population density at the landscape scale rather than sudden and widespread range retraction.},

  abstract = {Tree-ring studies of long-term growth trends have often produced controversial results. In such studies, the largest-diameter trees in a stand are usually sampled. We assessed the influence of stand dynamics on long-term growth trends by examining the past diameters of all the trees living in two uneven-aged subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in the Italian eastern Alps, as reconstructed from ring widths. The trees were ordered according to diameter, and groups of 12 trees (the 12 largest, the 12 smallest, etc.) were formed. Different diameter groups have different increment curves. In both stands, the 12 largest trees in 1992 have not had consistently faster growth rates than smaller trees. This indicates that changes in diameter ranking order have occurred in the past and may be expected in the future. During stand development, changes occur in the relative position of individual trees, as ordered by diameter. The largest-diameter trees, at any time, may not always have been the largest trees and may not continue to be so. In a given year, the largest trees on average grow slower than other trees, which will become the largest in the future. The mean chronologies of the trees that were among the largest, prior to the harvest, and which presently (in 1992) are no longer in the top 12, and the mean chronologies of the trees that have moved up into the top 12 show very different growth trends. If analysed out of context, they would be interpreted differently, leading to different conclusions on long-term growth trends. When only the 12 largest-diameter trees are sampled, a bias may be present, as the trees may not have been open grown and free of competition in the past. Consequently, studies of long-term growth may be seriously affected by bias attributable to stand dynamics and sampling strategies. In future studies, the growth patterns of all diameter classes in a stand should be assessed, rather than restricting the sampling to the largest diameters.},

From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for ``filling the gaps'' for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

FPE is important for both forest production and atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake. We find that FPE increases with absolute latitude, precipitation and (all else equal) with temperature. Earlier findings\textemdash FPE declining with age\textemdash are also supported by this analysis. However, the temperature effect is opposite to what would be expected based on the short-term physiological response of respiration rates to temperature, implying a top-down regulation of carbon loss, perhaps reflecting the higher carbon costs of nutrient acquisition in colder climates. Current ecosystem models do not reproduce this phenomenon. They consistently predict lower FPE in warmer climates, and are therefore likely to overestimate carbon losses in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {In dendroclimatology, tree-ring indices are traditionally calculated as part of the tree-ring chronology development process. This is accomplished by fitting a growth curve to the ring-width series and using it as a series of expectations for more or less well specified null conditions (uniform climate perhaps) of annual radial growth. The ratio of the actual ring widths to these expectations produces a set of dimensionless indices that can be averaged arithmetically with cross-dated indices from other trees into a mean chronology suitable for studies of climatic and environmental change. We show that tree-ring indices calculated in this manner can be systematically biased. The shape of this bias is defined by the reciprocal of the growth curve used to calculate the indices, and its magnitude depends on the proximity of the growth curve to the time axis and its intercept. The underlying cause, however, is lack of fit. To avoid this bias, residuals from the growth curve, rather than ratios, can be computed. If this is done, in conjunction with appropriate transformations to stabilize the variance, the resulting tree-ring chronology will not be biased in the way that ratios can be. This bias problem is demonstrated in an annual tree-ring chronology of bristlecone pine from Campito Mountain, which has been used previously in global change studies. We show that persistent growth increase since AD 1900 in that series is over-estimated by 23.6\% on average when ratios are used instead of residuals, depending on how the ring widths are transformed. Such bias in ratios is not always serious, as it depends on the joint behaviour of the growth curve and data, particularly near the ends of the data interval. Consequently, ratios can still be used safely in many situations. However, to avoid the possibility of ratio bias problems, we recommend that variance-stabilized residuals be used.},

Traditionally, methods of tree-ring analysis, or more properly in this case methods 0/ dendrochronology, were developed and used for dating archaeological and historical structures and for reconstructing past climates. The classic book Tree Rings and Climate, by H.C. Fritts, published in 1976, provided a superb introduction to the science and an in-depth description of techniques useful for extracting climatic information from tree rings. This book, which was published by Academic Press, is sadly out of print and, even though only 12 years old, lim\- ited in its methods and applications. This is owing to the extremely rapid development of the science since the 1970s. Only recently have tree rings as environmental sensors been fully recog\- nized as a valuable tool in detecting environmental change. For example, tree\- ring measurements have been critically important in studies of forest decline in Europe and North America. There are also attempts to use tree-ring analysis for ecological prognosis to solve large-scale regional problems including the sustain\- ability of water supplies, prediction of agricultural crops, and adoption of silvi\- cultural measures in response to ecological changes. More speculatively, dendro\- chronological methods are also used for dating and evaluating some astrophysical phenomena and for indicating possible increase in the biospheric carrying capac\- ity due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.},

This method is superior to orthogonal polynomials because it makes no assumptions about the shape of the curve to be used for standardization. Also, because the spline curve can range continuously from a linear least squares fit to cubic interpolation through the data, it is far more flexible than polynomials and provides a more "natural" fit. For computing the spline, we found that specifying the Lagrange multiplier p which appears in the calculus of variation solution rather than the residual variance as suggested by Reinsche was both practical and more efficient. In effect, the smoothing spline is a one-parameter family of low-pass filters defined by p. We describe the general characteristics of these filters in the time and frequency domains and compute the response functions for several of them. The smoothing spline is an excellent tree-ring standardization method because its filtering characteristics are well defined. Its utility for dendroclimatology should be considerable since, outside of semiarid environments, sites similar to forest interiors predominate.},

Using a literature survey, we showed that many tree species exhibit continuous vertical variation in hydraulic traits. To examine the effects of this variation on hydraulic function, we developed a spatially explicit, analytical water transport model for stems. Our model allows Huber ratio, stem-saturated conductivity, pressure at 50\% loss of conductivity, leaf area, and transpiration rate to vary continuously along the hydraulic path. Predictions from our model differ from a matric flux potential model parameterized with uniform traits. Analyses show that cavitation is a whole-stem emergent property resulting from non-linear pressure-conductivity feedbacks that, with gravity, cause impaired water transport to accumulate along the path. Because of the compounding effects of vertical trait variation on hydraulic function, growing proportionally more sapwood and building tapered xylem with height, as well as reducing xylem vulnerability only at branch tips while maintaining transport capacity at the stem base, can compensate for these effects. We therefore conclude that the adaptive significance of vertical variation in stem hydraulic traits is to allow trees to grow tall and tolerate operating near their hydraulic limits.},

Just over a quarter of global forest loss is due to deforestation through permanent land use change for the production of commodities, including beef, soy, palm oil, and wood fiber. Despite regional differences and efforts by governments, conservationists, and corporations to stem the losses, the overall rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined since 2001. Science, this issue p. 1108 Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27\% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26\%), shifting agriculture (24\%), and wildfire (23\%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year. A high-resolution global map enables a classification of the main drivers of forest loss.

  abstract = {Forest succession contributes to the global terrestrial carbon (C) sink, but changes in C sequestration in response to varied harvest intensities have been debated. The forests of the Central Appalachian region have been aggrading over the past 100 years following widespread clear-cutting that occurred in the early 1900s and these forests are now valuable timberlands. This study compared the history of ecosystem C storage in four watersheds that have been harvested at different frequencies and intensities since 1958. We compared NPP, NEP, and component ecosystem C fluxes (gCm-2year-1) in response to the four different harvest histories (no harvest, clear-cutting, single tree selection cutting, and 43cm diameter-limit cutting). Clear-cutting had short-term negative effects on NEP but harvest did not significantly impact long-term average annual C sequestration rates. Average plant C (gCm-2) since 1950 was about 33\% lower in response to a clear-cut event than plant C in an un-harvested forest, suggesting that the C sequestration associated with clear-cutting practices would decline over time and result in lower C storage than diameter-limit cut, selective cut, or un-harvested forests. Total C stored over a 55-year period was stimulated {$\sim$}37\% with diameter-limit cutting and selective cutting relative to un-harvested forests.},

They are also very hard to measure and so tend to be underrepresented in measurements and models of AGB. We show the first detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) estimates of the volume and AGB of large coastal redwood Sequoia sempervirens trees from three sites in Northern California, representing some of the highest biomass ecosystems on Earth. Our TLS estimates agree to within 2\% AGB with a species-specific model based on detailed manual crown mapping of 3D tree structure. However TLS-derived AGB was more than 30\% higher compared to widely-used general (non species-specific) allometries. We derive an allometry from TLS that spans a much greater range of tree size than previous models and so is potentially better-suited for use with new Earth Observation data for these exceptionally high biomass areas. We suggest that where possible, TLS and crown mapping should be used to provide complementary, independent 3D structure measurements of these very large trees.},

Four new white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) ring-width chronologies from four sites along a 30 kilometer north-south transect in the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve on the Alaskan Peninsula span a common interval from AD 1769 to 2003. Two sites show an internally consistent positive growth response to increasing April\textendash July temperatures after 1950. The two other sites each contain two subpopulations showing varying growth responses. One subpopulation diverges from historical temperature data after 1950 and one shows increased growth consistent with warming or exceeds expected growth increases. The growth decline may be due to temperature-induced drought stress that acts on some trees. Unprecedented climatic changes are triggering diverse growth responses between and within study sites that may greatly complicate dendroclimatic reconstructions of past climate conditions.},

Demographic inferences suggest, however, that typical sampling procedures induce spurious trends in growth reconstructions. Here we use the world's largest single tree-ring dataset (283,536 trees from 136,621 sites) from Quebec, Canada, to assess to what extent growth reconstructions based on these - and thus any similar - data might be affected by this problem. Indeed, straightforward growth rate reconstructions based on these data suggest a six-fold increase in radial growth of black spruce (Picea mariana) from \textasciitilde 0.5\,mm\,yr-1 in 1800 to \textasciitilde 2.5\,mm\,yr-1 in 1990. While the strong correlation (R2\,=\,0.98) between this increase and that of atmospheric CO2 could suggest a causal relationship, we here unambiguously demonstrate that this growth trend is an artefact of sampling biases caused by the absence of old, fast-growing trees (cf. ``slow-grower survivorship bias'') and of young, slow-growing trees (cf. ``big-tree selection bias'') in the dataset. At the moment, we cannot envision how to remedy the issue of incomplete representation of cohorts in existing large-scale tree-ring datasets. Thus, innovation will be needed before such datasets can be used for growth rate reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Causes of decline and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) mortality in Central Europe have been controversially discussed for a long time. This contribution details a comprehensive dendroecological investigation of two basic and alternative hypotheses that explain the decline by either climatic influences or by SO2 pollution as the primary factors. Growth reduction between the 1960s and 1980s as well as the recovery of growth during recent decades have be seen as a response to complex interactions of multiple factors. Herein, we undertake a multidisciplinary evaluation of a broad database, representing the long-term growth of 1010 firs from 51 sites, long-term climate records as well as data assessing the long-term pollution situation in Southern Germany. The results provide clear evidence that SO2-immissions play a key role in decline and that tree growth corresponds with the regional and temporal pattern of SO2 pollution. Calculations with a new complex growth model indicate that tree-ring widths of fir at many sites were more influenced by SO2 than by any other growth-determining factor during the second half of the last century. Strongest coherence between measured and modelled ring widths are found if \textendash{} in addition to temperature, available soil water content, heavy frost events and long-term growth trends \textendash{} the site-specific trend of SO2 pollution is included. Both the immediate response to SO2 pollution and the quick recovery of fir since the beginning of the 1980s after the decrease of SO2 emissions indicate a direct impact of SO2 in gaseous form and not via the soil in terms of soil acidification. Tree-ring widths document that radial growth response occurs at air concentrations above 10{$\mu$}gSO2m-3 (annual average), which can be thought of as a critical threshold for silver fir health. Since the beginning of the 1980s, increasing growth trends have been observed which predominantly result from decreased SO2 pollution in most parts of Central Europe, although climate change, fertilization by nitrogen deposition and a reduced tree-to-tree competition are also relevant factors. The drastic reduction of SO2 emission during the recent decades significantly improved the environmental conditions for fir. Consequently, an increased cultivation of silver fir on suitable sites is recommended.},

  abstract = {How, where, and why carbon (C) moves into and out of an ecosystem through time are long-standing questions in biogeochemistry. Here, we bring together hundreds of thousands of C-cycle observations at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA, a mid-latitude landscape dominated by 80\textendash 120-yr-old closed-canopy forests. These data answered four questions: (1) where and how much C is presently stored in dominant forest types; (2) what are current rates of C accrual and loss; (3) what biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variability in these rates; and (4) how has climate change affected the forest's C cycle? Harvard Forest is an active C sink resulting from forest regrowth following land abandonment. Soil and tree biomass comprise nearly equal portions of existing C stocks. Net primary production (NPP) averaged 680\textendash 750 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1; belowground NPP contributed 38\textendash 47\% of the total, but with large uncertainty. Mineral soil C measured in the same inventory plots in 1992 and 2013 was too heterogeneous to detect change in soil-C pools; however, radiocarbon data suggest a small but persistent sink of 10\textendash 30 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. Net ecosystem production (NEP) in hardwood stands averaged 300 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1. NEP in hemlock-dominated forests averaged 450 g C{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1 until infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid turned these stands into a net C source. Since 2000, NPP has increased by 26\%. For the period 1992\textendash 2015, NEP increased 93\%. The increase in mean annual temperature and growing season length alone accounted for 30\% of the increase in productivity. Interannual variations in GPP and NEP were also correlated with increases in red oak biomass, forest leaf area, and canopy-scale light-use efficiency. Compared to long-term global change experiments at the Harvard Forest, the C sink in regrowing biomass equaled or exceeded C cycle modifications imposed by soil warming, N saturation, and hemlock removal. Results of this synthesis and comparison to simulation models suggest that forests across the region are likely to accrue C for decades to come but may be disrupted if the frequency or severity of biotic and abiotic disturbances increases.},

  abstract = {Relationships between tree size and growth are sometimes assumed to show increasing growth with increasing size only until intermediate sizes are reached, followed by a phase where growth rates decline with further increases in size. However, this ``rise-and-fall'' pattern has been challenged by studies suggesting continuously increasing growth with size. This study examined relationships between tree diameter and above-ground biomass (AGB) growth and how such relationships can differ depending on whether they represent an individual tree through time (longitudinal analyses) or whether the relationship was fit to many trees within a stand at a single point in time (cross-sectional analyses). Using 949 long-term plots in Switzerland (measured between 1888 and 2014) including several species, sites and management regimes, segmented regressions were used to describe the longitudinal and cross-sectional relationships between stem diameter and AGB growth. The slopes of the last segments of cross-sectional analyses indicated that AGB growth generally increased with tree diameter. However, last-segment slopes of longitudinal analyses showed that AGB growth of 12\% of trees had actually declined for several decades. This number increased to 44\%, when considering only the last growth periods for each tree, corresponding to about 16~years of growth. The contrast between cross-sectional and longitudinal patterns results because declines in tree growth occur at different times or sizes for different individuals (longitudinal analyses), but this is averaged out and rarely evident from cross-sectional analyses unless many individuals decline at similar times or sizes. The last-segment slopes of individual trees were positively correlated with the last-segment slopes of relationships between diameter and tree light absorption or light-use efficiency (AGB/light absorption). Interestingly, last-segment slopes were not correlated with light absorption, only the change in light absorption. This reiterates the potential of thinning to delay the onset of growth declines. When all data were combined (e.g. an aggregated longitudinal analysis), AGB growth was most strongly influenced by diameter, followed by relative height, neighbourhood basal area, climatic conditions, silviculture, and lastly, tree species diversity. Cross-sectional analyses often show AGB growth continuously increasing with diameter, because firstly, they represent patterns averaged across may trees within a stand and secondly, because they represent only one point in time. However, the AGB growth of individual trees doesn't always continuously increase with tree diameter (longitudinal analyses). This highlights the importance of carefully considering which type of analysis (cross-sectional or longitudinal) is appropriate to the question being addressed.},

Forests' ongoing ability to sequester C depends on how tree communities respond to changes in climate variation. Much of what we know about tree and forest response to climate variation comes from tree-ring records. Yet typical tree-ring datasets and models do not capture the diversity of climate responses that exist within and among trees and species. We address this issue using a model that estimates individual tree response to climate variables while accounting for variation in individuals' size, age, competitive status, and spatially structured latent covariates. Our model allows for inference about variance within and among species. We quantify how variables influence aboveground biomass growth of individual trees from a representative sample of 15 northern or southern tree species growing in a transition zone between boreal and temperate biomes. Individual trees varied in their growth response to fluctuating mean annual temperature and summer moisture stress. The variation among individuals within a species was wider than mean differences among species. The effects of mean temperature and summer moisture stress interacted, such that warm years produced positive responses to summer moisture availability and cool years produced negative responses. As climate models project significant increases in annual temperatures, growth of species like Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Picea glauca will vary more in response to summer moisture stress than in the past. The magnitude of biomass growth variation in response to annual climate was 92\textendash 95\% smaller than responses to tree size and age. This means that measuring or predicting the physical structure of current and future forests could tell us more about future C dynamics than growth responses related to climate change alone.},

The models were forced by historical emissions and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 anthropogenic emissions of CO2 for the 1850\textendash 2100 time period. For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1\textdegree{} and 1.5\textdegree C. All models simulated a negative sensitivity for both the land and the ocean carbon cycle to future climate. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. Also, a majority of the models located the reduction of land carbon uptake in the Tropics. However, the attribution of the land sensitivity to changes in net primary productivity versus changes in respiration is still subject to debate; no consensus emerged among the models.},

A variety of structural characteristics of tree rings, such as width, wood density, and vessel size exhibit variability from one ring to the next. The principles and practices of dendroecology\textemdash namely, uniformitarianism, limiting factors, crossdating, standardization, variance of the mean and the signal-to-noise ratio, sample replication, tree and site selection, calibration and verification, and modeling are essentially the fundamental framework for understanding the discipline of dendroecology.

  abstract = {Droughts, which are characterized by multiple dimensions including frequency, duration, severity, and onset timing, can impact tree stem radial growth profoundly. Different dimensions of drought influence tree stem radial growth independently or jointly, which makes the development of accurate predictions a formidable challenge. Measurement-based tree-ring data have obvious advantages for studying the drought responses of trees. Here, we explored the use of abundant tree-ring records for quantifying regional response patterns to key dimensions of drought. Specifically, we designed a series of regional-scaled ``natural experiments,'' based on 357 tree-ring chronologies from Southwest USA and location-matched monthly water balance anomalies, to reveal how tree-ring responds to each dimension of drought. Our results showed that tree-ring was affected significantly more by the water balance condition in the current hydrological year than that in the prior hydrological year. Within the current hydrological year, increased drought frequency (number of dry months) and duration (maximum number of consecutive dry months) resulted in ``cumulative effects'' which amplified the impacts of drought on trees and reduced the drought resistance of trees. Drought events that occurred in the pregrowing seasons strongly affected subsequent tree stem radial growth. Both the onset timing and severity of drought increased ``legacy effects'' on tree stem radial growth, which reduced the drought resilience of trees. These results indicated that the drought impact on trees is a dynamic process: even when the total water deficits are the same, differences among the drought processes could lead to considerably different responses from trees. This study thus provides a conceptual framework and probabilistic patterns of tree-ring growth response to multiple dimensions of drought regimes, which in turn may have a wide range of implications for predictions, uncertainty assessment, and forest management.},

  abstract = {It is well known that temperatures across the globe are rising, but climatic conditions are becoming more variable as well. Forecasts of species range shifts, however, often focus on average climatic changes while ignoring increasing climatic variability. In particular, many species distribution models use space-for-time substitution, which focuses exclusively on the effect of average climatic conditions on the target species across a geographic range, and is blind to the possibility of range-wide population collapse with increasing drought frequency, drought severity, or climate effects on other co-occurring species. Relegated to assessments of broad demographic patterns that ignore underlying biological responses to increasing climatic variability, this prevalent method of distribution forecasting may systematically underpredict climate change impacts. We compare six models of survival and abundance of a subcanopy tree species, Taxus brevifolia, over 40~years of past climate change to disentangle multiple sources of uncertainty: model formulation, scale of climate effect, and level of biological organization. We show that drought extremes increased Taxus individual- and population-scale mortality across a wide geographic climate gradient, precluding detection of a monotonic relationship with average climate. Individual-scale climatic extremes models derived from longitudinal data had the highest predictive accuracy (82\%), whereas mean climate models had the lowest accuracy ({$<$}\,65\%). Our results highlight that conclusions drawn from forecasts of average warming alone likely underpredict climate change impacts by ignoring indicators of range-wide population declines for species sensitive to increasing climatic variability.},

However, mixing effects on drought responses vary substantially with site conditions and species identity. We combined annually resolved tree-ring data and repeated forest inventory data spanning the last 90~years to examine the effect of species-specific neighbourhood competition on the drought response (resistance, recovery and resilience) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) for six drought events that occurred since the 1970s at three sites in Switzerland. We found predominantly weak neighbourhood competition and tree species diversity effects, with significant interspecific influences only for resistance and recovery of beech. These minor neighbourhood effects were outweighed by tree age and size effects. Although age effects depended on species identity and components of resilience, tree size consistently negatively affected all species. Our results emphasize that diversity effects may vary for each given species combination which makes broader conclusions challenging. This is because species interact through their specific set of traits and interactions vary in space and time. Adaptive management strategies are likely to be more effective when they promote more drought-tolerant species and reductions in stand density. Despite the absence of an unequivocal advantage of tree diversity on drought resilience, striving towards species-rich forests nonetheless allows for a risk spreading among multiple species and the reinforced provision of numerous ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Tree mortality is one of the most influential drivers of forest dynamics, and characterizing patterns of tree mortality is critical to understanding forest dynamics and ecosystem function in the present era of global change. Here, we use a unique data set of mortality in a temperate deciduous forest to characterize rates and drivers of mortality. At the 25.6-ha Center for Tropical Forest Science\textemdash Forest Global Earth Observatory forest dynamics plot at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (Virginia, USA), we conducted two full tree censuses in 2008 and 2013 and then tracked mortality over the next 2~years (2014 and 2015). Overall, the mortality rate, m, of stems {$\geq$}10~cm diameter was 1.3\textendash 2.1\%/yr. Biomass mortality, M, was 1.9\textendash 3.4~Mg{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1 at the stand level (0.6\textendash 1.1\%/yr of biomass), less than biomass gains from growth and recruitment, resulting in net live biomass accumulation. Small stems died at the highest rate; however, contributions to M increased toward larger size classes. Most species had m~{$<~$}2\%/yr and M~{$<~$}0.25~Mg{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1 ({$<$}3\%/yr of biomass), whereas two to four species had anomalously high mortality rates during each census period, accounting for 15\textendash 24\% of m (n~=~2, Cercis canadensis, Ulmus species) and 39\textendash 75\% of M (n~=~4 Quercus species). Stems that died, whether or not in association with mechanical damage, tended to grow more slowly in preceding years than surviving stems and, for certain shade-intolerant species, tended to be in neighborhoods with higher basal area. These findings show how relatively fine-scale mortality processes contribute to stand-level compositional change and carbon cycling. The mortality patterns reported here will provide a valuable basis for understanding future disturbance events within eastern deciduous forests and for comparing across forest types.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, but the amount of carbon they contain and its spatial distribution remain uncertain. Recent studies suggest that once tree height is accounted for in biomass calculations, in addition to diameter and wood density, carbon stock estimates are reduced in many areas. However, it is possible that larger crown sizes might offset the reduction in biomass estimates in some forests where tree heights are lower because even comparatively short trees develop large, well-lit crowns in or above the forest canopy. While current allometric models and theory focus on diameter, wood density, and height, the influence of crown size and structure has not been well studied. To test the extent to which accounting for crown parameters can improve biomass estimates, we harvested and weighed 51 trees (11\textendash 169 cm diameter) in southwestern Amazonia where no direct biomass measurements have been made. The trees in our study had nearly half of total aboveground biomass in the branches (44\% {$\pm$} 2\% [mean {$\pm$} SE]), demonstrating the importance of accounting for tree crowns. Consistent with our predictions, key pantropical equations that include height, but do not account for crown dimensions, underestimated the sum total biomass of all 51 trees by 11\% to 14\%, primarily due to substantial underestimates of many of the largest trees. In our models, including crown radius greatly improves performance and reduces error, especially for the largest trees. In addition, over the full data set, crown radius explained more variation in aboveground biomass (10.5\%) than height (6.0\%). Crown form is also important: Trees with a monopodial architectural type are estimated to have 21\textendash 44\% less mass than trees with other growth patterns. Our analysis suggests that accounting for crown allometry would substantially improve the accuracy of tropical estimates of tree biomass and its distribution in primary and degraded forests.},

  abstract = {The aim of our study was to determine variation in the response of radial growth in Fagus sylvatica L (European Beech) to climate across the species full geographical distribution and climatic tolerance. We combined new and existing data to build a database of 140 tree-ring chronologies to investigate patterns in growth\textendash climate relationships. Our novel meta-analysis approach has allowed the first investigation of the effect of climate on tree growth across the entire geographical distribution of the species. We identified key climate signals in tree-ring chronologies and then investigated how these varied geographically and according to mean local climate, and by tree age and size. We found that the most important climate variables significantly correlated with growth did not show strong geographical patterns. Growth of trees in the core and at the southern edge of the distribution was reduced by high temperature and low precipitation during the growing season, and by high temperatures in the previous summer. However, growth of trees growing in warmer and drier locations was more frequently significantly correlated with summer precipitation than other populations. Additionally, the growth of older and larger trees was more frequently significantly correlated with previous summer temperature than younger and smaller trees. Trees growing at the south of the species geographical distributions are often considered most at risk from climate change, but our results indicate that radial growth of populations in other areas of the distribution is equally likely to be significantly correlated with summer climate and may also be vulnerable. Additionally, tree-rings from older trees contain particular growth\textendash climate relationships that are rarely found in younger trees. These results have important implications for predicting forest carbon balance, resource use and likely future changes to forest composition across the continent.},

For the first time, we combined long-term annual growth and forest census data of a diverse temperate broadleaf deciduous forest, seeking to resolve whether ANPPstem is primarily moisture- or energy-limited and whether climate sensitivity has changed in recent decades characterised by more mesic conditions and elevated CO2. We analysed tree-ring chronologies across 109 yr of monthly climatic variation (1901\textendash 2009) for 14 species representing 97\% of ANPPstem in a 25.6 ha plot in northern Virginia, USA. Radial growth of most species and ecosystem-level ANPPstem responded positively to cool, moist growing season conditions, but the same conditions in the previous May\textendash July were associated with reduced growth. In recent decades (1980\textendash 2009), responses were more variable and, on average, weaker. Our results indicated that woody productivity is primarily limited by current growing season moisture, as opposed to temperature or sunlight, but additional complexity in climate sensitivity may reflect the use of stored carbohydrate reserves. Overall, while such forests currently display limited moisture sensitivity, their woody productivity is likely to decline under projected hotter and potentially drier growing season conditions.},

In this study, we analyzed historical time trends in stemwood biomass growth derived from black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) trees at 248 plots across Canada. The sample consisted of trees that were live and dominant at the time of sampling (LDS). Observations of stemwood biomass of LDS trees at a reference age of 75 years (Bsw75,LDS) increased by 154 to 321\% over 1901\textendash 2001 depending on the method of trend estimation. Simulations from a calibrated individual-based Growth and Yield model\textemdash forced with varying degrees of hypothetical trend in tree growth\textemdash were used to estimate the proportion of trend that could be attributed to intrinsic factors, including artefacts introduced by sampling from LDS trees instead of from the population of trees. Imposing no time trend in simulated tree growth, stemwood biomass of 75-year-old LDS trees (Bsw75,LDS,Model) increased by 63\% (41 to 85\% CI). We conclude that the remaining variation in growth of LDS trees (154 to 321\% minus 63\% = 91 to 258\%) can be attributed to net extrinsic forcing. The scaling relationship between LDS and population trees further suggested that stemwood biomass growth of the population (Gsw75,POP) increased by 47 to 82\%. By accounting for both natural dynamics and artefacts of the sampling design in estimation of net intrinsic forcing, we gained confidence that growth rate of black spruce trees across Canada increased significantly over 1901\textendash 2001. While growth enhancement is consistent with beneficial effects of increasing levels of reactive nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and warming, there remains uncertainty in the degree that applied procedures fully account for known sampling artefacts.},

Location Temperate forests in southern South America. Methods New and existing tree-ring radial growth chronologies representing the entire latitudinal range of Pilgerodendron uviferum were grouped according to latitude and then examined for differences in growth trends and non-stationarity in growth responses to a drought severity index (scPDSI) over the 1900\textendash 1993 AD period and also before and after significant shifts in climate in the 1950s and 1970s. Results The radial-growth response of P. uviferum climate was highly variable across its full latitudinal distribution. There was a long-term and positive association between radial growth and higher moisture at the northern and southern edges of the distribution of this species and the opposite relationship for the core of its distribution, especially following the climatic shifts of the 1950s and 1970s. In addition, non-stationarity in moisture-radial growth relationships was observed in all three latitudinal groups (southern and northern edges and core) for all seasons during the 20th century. Main conclusions Climate shifts in southern South America in the 1950s and 1970s resulted in different responses in the mean radial growth of P. uviferum at the southern and northern edges and at the core of its range. Dendroclimatic analyses document that during the first half of the 20th century climate-growth relationships were relatively similar between the southern and northern range edges but diverged after the 1950s. Our findings imply that simulated projections of climate impacts on tree growth, and by implication on forest ecosystem productivity, derived from models of past climate-growth relationships need to carefully consider different and non-stationarity responses along the wide latitudinal distribution of this species.},

  abstract = {A method is developed for estimating the uncertainty (standard error) of observed regional, hemispheric, and global-mean surface temperature series due to incomplete spatial sampling. Standard errors estimated at the grid-box level [SE2 = S2(1 - r)/(1 + (n - 1)r)] depend upon three parameters: the number of site records (n) within each box, the average interrecord correlation (r) between these sites, and the temporal variability (S2) of each grid-box temperature time series. For boxes without data (n = 0), estimates are made using values of S2 interpolated from neighboring grid boxes. Due to spatial correlation, large-scale standard errors in a regional-mean time series are not simply the average of the grid-box standard errors, but depend upon the effective number of independent sites (Neff) over the region. A number of assumptions must be made in estimating the various parameters, and these are tested with observational data and complementary results from multicentury control integrations of three coupled general circulation models (GCMs). The globally complete GCMs enable some assumptions to be tested in a situation where there are no missing data; comparison of parameters computed from the observed and model datasets are also useful for assessing the performance of GCMs. As most of the parameters are timescale dependent, the resulting errors are likewise timescale dependent and must be calculated for each timescale of interest. The length of the observed record enables uncertainties to be estimated on the interannual and interdecadal timescales, with the longer GCM runs providing inferences about longer timescales. For mean annual observed data on the interannual timescale, the 95\% confidence interval for estimates of the global-mean surface temperature since 1951 is 9p 0.12\textdegree C. Prior to 1900, the confidence interval widens to 9p 0.18\textdegree C. Equivalent values on the decadal timescale are smaller: 9p 0.10\textdegree C (1951-95) and 9p 0.16\textdegree C (1851-1900).},

In addition to a strong genetic control of tolerance to the fungus, previous studies have found landscape heterogeneity to be an additional driver of variability in the severity of dieback symptoms. However, apart from climatic conditions related to heat and humidity influencing fungal infection success, the mechanistic understanding of why smaller or slower-growing trees are more susceptible to dieback remains less well understood. Here, we analyzed three stands in Switzerland with a unique setting of 8 years of data availability of intra-annual diameter growth and annual crown health assessments. We complemented this by ring width and quantitative wood anatomical measurements extending back before the monitoring started to investigate if wood anatomical adjustments can help better explain the size-related dieback phenomenon. We found that slower-growing trees or trees with smaller crowns already before the arrival of the fungus were more susceptible to dieback and mortality. Defoliation directly reduced growth as well as maximum earlywood vessel size, and the positive relationship between vessel size and growth rate caused a positive feedback amplifying and accelerating crown dieback. Measured non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the outermost five rings did not significantly vary between healthy and weakened trees, which translate into large differences in absolute available amount of NSCs. Thus, we hypothesize that a lack of NSCs (mainly sugars) leads to lower turgor pressure and smaller earlywood vessels in the following year. This might impede efficient water transport and photosynthesis, and be responsible for stronger symptoms of dieback and higher mortality rates in smaller and slower-growing trees.},

A growth increase and decrease with warming is usually observed in cold-humid and warm-dry regions, respectively. However, it remains poorly known where the sign of these temperature effects switches. Here we introduce a newly developed European tree-ring network that has been specifically collected to reconstruct forest aboveground biomass increment (ABI). We quantify, how the long-term (1910-2009) inter-annual variability of ABI depends on local mean May-August temperature and test, if a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) ensemble reflects the resulting patterns. We find that sites at 8\textdegree C mean May-August temperature increase ABI on average by 5.7{$\pm$}1.3 \%, whereas sites at 20\textdegree C decrease ABI by 3.0{$\pm$}1.8 \% m-2 y-1 {$\increment^\circ$}C-1. A threshold temperature between beneficial and detrimental effects of warming and the associated increase in water demand on tree growth emerged at 15.9{$\pm$}1.4\textdegree C mean May-August temperature. Because inter-annual variability increases proportionally with mean growth rate \textendash{} i.e. the coefficient of variation stays constant \textendash{} we were able to validate these findings with a much larger tree-ring dataset that had been established following classic dendrochronological sampling schemes. While the observed climate sensitivity pattern is well reflected in the DGVM ensemble, there is a large spread of threshold temperatures between the individual models. Also, individual models disagree strongly on the magnitude of climate impact at the coldest and warmest locations, suggesting where model improvement is most needed to more accurately predict forest growth and effectively guide silvicultural practices.},

The IAV is largely driven by hydrological conditions throughout the water year from previous August to current August (r SPEI = 0.56; 1st differenced r = 0.75, p {$<$} 0.001). During extremely dry years (such as 1972, 1976, 1998, and 2011), the carbon accumulation was reduced up to 63 \% from the long-term mean. Furthermore, our analysis explores possible biases of annual ABI derived from manual band dendrometers in permanent plot inventories caused by water status related changes in tree size. During the snow breakage event in March 2012 and subsequent management activities, 17 \% of the standing biomass was killed. We estimate that the remaining trees will take \textasciitilde 16 years to make up for the loss of this disturbance, assuming a similar growth rate of the remaining trees as during the previous 60 years and that a potentially drier climate and the increased water availability for the remaining trees will balance each other. We demonstrate that well-replicated, representative tree-ring datasets have a huge potential to complement shorter-term and lower-resolution forest inventory monitoring data. Integrating tree-ring and plot data allow one to gain knowledge about annual changes in forest productivity even before monitoring started and help ecosystem managers to better adapt their strategies.},

  abstract = {Shaping global water and carbon cycles, plants lift water from roots to leaves through xylem conduits. The importance of xylem water conduction makes it crucial to understand how natural selection deploys conduit diameters within and across plants. Wider conduits transport more water but are likely more vulnerable to conduction-blocking gas embolisms and cost more for a plant to build, a tension necessarily shaping xylem conduit diameters along plant stems. We build on this expectation to present the Widened Pipe Model (WPM) of plant hydraulic evolution, testing it against a global dataset. The WPM predicts that xylem conduits should be narrowest at the stem tips, widening quickly before plateauing toward the stem base. This universal profile emerges from Pareto modeling of a trade-off between just two competing vectors of natural selection: one favoring rapid widening of conduits tip to base, minimizing hydraulic resistance, and another favoring slow widening of conduits, minimizing carbon cost and embolism risk. Our data spanning terrestrial plant orders, life forms, habitats, and sizes conform closely to WPM predictions. The WPM highlights carbon economy as a powerful vector of natural selection shaping plant function. It further implies that factors that cause resistance in plant conductive systems, such as conduit pit membrane resistance, should scale in exact harmony with tip-to-base conduit widening. Furthermore, the WPM implies that alterations in the environments of individual plants should lead to changes in plant height, for example, shedding terminal branches and resprouting at lower height under drier climates, thus achieving narrower and potentially more embolism-resistant conduits.},

  abstract = {After the last glaciation, around 4000 BC, silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) spread to the area that is now the Czech Republic. This spread was not restricted to high mountains, but also took place across both highland and lowland landscapes. Historical forestry records from around AD 1500 mention a massive expansion of Abies alba, favoured by forest pasturing, litter raking and selective tree cutting. According to the current interpretation of these historical records, this expansion in Czech forests was extensive and lasted until AD 1800. On the other hand, pollen data coming mostly from the Alps consider silver fir as a species that is extremely sensitive to human impact. In this paper, we compare historical forestry reports with pollen and charcoal data from the Czech Republic. Both pollen and charcoal records show that Abies alba reached its maximum during the Bronze (2200\textemdash 800/750 BC) and Iron Ages (800/750 BC\textemdash AD 0). While charcoal records indicate that silver fir wood was important also during the High Medieval, pollen data show that the High Medieval and Modern times were periods of a general decline in  Abies. Our data suggest that the expansion of silver fir documented by historical records was not general but rather fragmented, probably according to actual form and the intensity of human impact, as well as environmental conditions. These historical records have contributed much evidence regarding the wider ecological tolerance of Abies.},

  abstract = {The temperature response of photosynthesis is one of the key factors determining predicted responses to warming in global vegetation models (GVMs). The response may vary geographically, owing to genetic adaptation to climate, and temporally, as a result of acclimation to changes in ambient temperature. Our goal was to develop a robust quantitative global model representing acclimation and adaptation of photosynthetic temperature responses. We quantified and modelled key mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic temperature acclimation and adaptation using a global dataset of photosynthetic CO2 response curves, including data from 141 C3 species from tropical rainforest to Arctic tundra. We separated temperature acclimation and adaptation processes by considering seasonal and common-garden datasets, respectively. The observed global variation in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis was primarily explained by biochemical limitations to photosynthesis, rather than stomatal conductance or respiration. We found acclimation to growth temperature to be a stronger driver of this variation than adaptation to temperature at climate of origin. We developed a summary model to represent photosynthetic temperature responses and showed that it predicted the observed global variation in optimal temperatures with high accuracy. This novel algorithm should enable improved prediction of the function of global ecosystems in a warming climate.},

  abstract = {Earth is currently undergoing a global increase in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a trend which is expected to continue as climate warms. This phenomenon has been associated with productivity decreases in ecosystems and yield penalties in crops, with these losses attributed to photosynthetic limitations arising from decreased stomatal conductance. Such VPD increases, however, have occurred over decades, which raises the possibility that stomatal acclimation to VPD plays an important role in determining plant productivity under high VPD. Furthermore, evidence points to more far-ranging and complex effects of elevated VPD on plant physiology, extending to the anatomical, biochemical, and developmental levels, which could vary substantially across species. Because these complex effects are typically not considered in modeling frameworks, we conducted a quantitative literature review documenting temperature-independent VPD effects on 112 species and 59 traits and physiological variables, in order to develop an integrated and mechanistic physiological framework. We found that VPD increase reduced yield and primary productivity, an effect that was partially mediated by stomatal acclimation, and also linked with changes in leaf anatomy, nutrient, and hormonal status. The productivity decrease was also associated with negative effects on reproductive development, and changes in architecture and growth rates that could decrease the evaporative surface or minimize embolism risk. Cross-species quantitative relationships were found between levels of VPD increase and trait responses, and we found differences across plant groups, indicating that future VPD impacts will depend on community assembly and crop functional diversity. Our analysis confirms predictions arising from the hydraulic corollary to Darcy's law, outlines a systemic physiological framework of plant responses to rising VPD, and provides recommendations for future research to better understand and mitigate VPD-mediated climate change effects on ecosystems and agro-systems.},

Large trees generally have lower rates of mortality than small trees and are more resilient to climate change, but these assumptions have rarely been examined in long-term studies. We combined data from 655 historical (1932-1936) and 210 modern (1988-1999) vegetation plots to examine changes in density of large-diameter trees in Yosemite National Park (3027 km2). We tested the assumption of stability for large-diameter trees, as both individual species and communities of large-diameter trees. Between the 1930s and 1990s, large-diameter tree density in Yosemite declined 24\%. Although the decrease was apparent in all forest types, declines were greatest in subalpine and upper montane forests (57.0\% of park area), and least in lower montane forests (15.3\% of park area). Large-diameter tree densities of 11 species declined while only 3 species increased. Four general patterns emerged: (1) Pinus albicaulis, Quercus chrysolepis, and Quercus kelloggii had increases in density of large-diameter trees occur throughout their ranges; (2) Pinus jeffreyi, Pinus lambertiana, and Pinus ponderosa, had disproportionately larger decreases in large-diameter tree densities in lower-elevation portions of their ranges; (3) Abies concolor and Pinus contorta, had approximately uniform decreases in large-diameter trees throughout their elevational ranges; and (4) Abies magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, Juniperus occidentalis, Pinus monticola, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga mertensiana displayed little or no change in large-diameter tree densities. In Pinus ponderosa-Calocedrus decurrens forests, modern large-diameter tree densities were equivalent whether or not plots had burned since 1936. However, in unburned plots, the large-diameter trees were predominantly A. concolor, C. decurrens, and Q. chrysolepis, whereas P. ponderosa dominated the large-diameter component of burned plots. Densities of large-diameter P. ponderosa were 8.1 trees ha-1 in plots that had experienced fire, but only 0.5 trees ha-1 in plots that remained unburned. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Broad-scale patterns of climatic limitations on tree growth remain poorly described across eastern North American deciduous forests. We examined the response of broadleaf tree species to climate in relation to their taxonomy, functional traits and geographical location. Location Eastern North America (32\textendash 45\textdegree ~N; 70\textendash 88\textdegree ~W). Methods We used a network of 86 tree-ring width chronologies from eight species that cover a wide range of ecological and climatic conditions. Species were analysed individually or combined according to taxa and wood anatomical functional traits. We identified climate stressors through correlations between growth and climate (from 1916 to 1996). We also explored patterns in the climate responses of these species with two clustering techniques. Results We found strong correlations between water availability and growth for all species. With few exceptions, this drought stress was independent of taxonomy or wood anatomical functional group. Depending on latitude, however, different climatic drivers governed this common drought response. In the cool, northern part of our network, forest growth was most strongly limited by precipitation variability, whereas maximum temperature was a stronger limiting factor than precipitation in the wetter and warmer southern parts. Main conclusions Our study highlights the sensitivity of broadleaf temperate forests to drought stress at annual to decadal scales, with few species-specific differences. The roles of temperature and precipitation on drought-sensitivity differ at opposing ends of our subcontinental-scale network. The impact of future environmental changes on these forests will ultimately depend on the balance between temperature and precipitation changes across this latitudinal gradient.},

  abstract = {In the 45 years after legislation of the Clean Air Act, there has been tremendous progress in reducing acidic air pollutants in the eastern United States, yet limited evidence exists that cleaner air has improved forest health. Here, we investigate the influence of recent environmental changes on the growth and physiology of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) trees, a key indicator species of forest health, spanning three locations along a 100 km transect in the Central Appalachian Mountains. We incorporated a multiproxy approach using 75-year tree ring chronologies of basal tree growth, carbon isotope discrimination ({$\increment$}13C, a proxy for leaf gas exchange), and {$\delta$}15N (a proxy for ecosystem N status) to examine tree and ecosystem level responses to environmental change. Results reveal the two most important factors driving increased tree growth since ca. 1989 are reductions in acidic sulfur pollution and increases in atmospheric CO2, while reductions in pollutant emissions of NOx and warmer springs played smaller, but significant roles. Tree ring {$\increment$}13C signatures increased significantly since 1989, concurrently with significant declines in tree ring {$\delta$}15N signatures. These isotope chronologies provide strong evidence that simultaneous changes in C and N cycling, including greater photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of trees and increases in ecosystem N retention, were related to recent increases in red spruce tree growth and are consequential to ecosystem recovery from acidic pollution. Intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) of the red spruce trees increased by 51\% across the 75-year chronology, and was driven by changes in atmospheric CO2 and acid pollution, but iWUE was not linked to recent increases in tree growth. This study documents the complex environmental interactions that have contributed to the recovery of red spruce forest ecosystems from pervasive acidic air pollution beginning in 1989, about 15 years after acidic pollutants started to decline in the United States.},

We show a {$\sim$}40\% increase in tree iWUE globally since 1901, coinciding with a {$\sim$}34\% increase in atmospheric CO2 (Ca), although mean iWUE, and the rates of increase, varied across biomes and leaf and wood functional types.

A dual carbon\textendash oxygen isotope approach revealed that increases in Anet dominated the observed increased iWUE in {$\sim$}83\% of examined cases, supporting recent reports of global increases in Anet, whereas reductions in gs occurred in the remaining {$\sim$}17\%. This meta-analysis provides a strong process-based framework for predicting changes in tree carbon gain and water loss across biomes and across wood and leaf functional types, and the interactions between Ca and other environmental factors have important implications for the coupled carbon\textendash hydrologic cycles under future climate.

  abstract = {Several important environmental influences of tree growth and carbon sequestration have changed over the past several decades in eastern North America, specifically, more frequent pluvial conditions, increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, and decreased acidic deposition. These factors could lead to changes in the relationship between tree growth and water availability, and perhaps even decouple the two, having large implications on how future climate change will impact forest productivity and carbon sequestration. Here, we examine the concurrent influence of the climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration), CO2 concentrations, and sulfate and nitrogen deposition on radial tree growth, carbon isotopes, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) for several hardwood tree species in the Midwestern United States. We found that when considering the simultaneous influence of these factors, the climatic water balance is the dominant influence on annual growth. Therefore, the recent pluvial period is the primary cause of the weakening relationship between radial growth and water availability. Even during pluvial periods, water availability is the primary control on growth, with increasing CO2 concentrations and decreased SO4 deposition being secondary factors. Importantly, the weakening in the climate-growth relationship is species specific, with Acer species having stable relationships with the climatic water balance, Liriodendron tulipifera showing a strengthening relationship, and Quercus species and Populus grandidentata exhibiting weakening. Thus, interannual variations in soil moisture unevenly impact tree growth and carbon sequestration. Our findings suggest that, despite recent pluvial conditions, increasing CO2 concentrations and decreasing acidic deposition have not buffered the impact of water availability on tree growth and carbon sequestration.},

Tree rings have long provided historical context of hydroclimate variability of the U.S. However, the tree-ring network used to create these countrywide gridded reconstructions is sparse in certain locations, such as the Midwest. Here, we increase (n~=~20) the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network in southern Indiana and compare a summer (June\textendash August) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruction to existing gridded reconstructions of PDSI for this region. We find both droughts and pluvials that were previously unknown that rival the most intense PDSI values during the instrumental period. Additionally, historical drought occurred in Indiana that eclipsed instrumental conditions with regard to severity and duration. During the period 1962\textendash 2004 CE, we find that teleconnections of drought conditions through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation have a strong influence (r~=~-0.60, p~{$<~$}0.01) on secondary tree growth in this region for the late spring-early summer season. These findings highlight the importance of continuing to increase the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network used to infer past climate dynamics to capture the sub-regional spatial variability. Increasing the spatial resolution of the tree-ring network for a given region can better identify sub-regional variability, improve the accuracy of regional tree-ring PDSI reconstructions, and provide better information for climatic teleconnections.},

  abstract = {Shifting forest dynamics Forest dynamics are the processes of recruitment, growth, death, and turnover of the constituent tree species of the forest community. These processes are driven by disturbances both natural and anthropogenic. McDowell et al. review recent progress in understanding the drivers of forest dynamics and how these are interacting and changing in the context of global climate change. The authors show that shifts in forest dynamics are already occurring, and the emerging pattern is that global forests are tending toward younger stands with faster turnover as old-growth forest with stable dynamics are dwindling. Science, this issue p. eaaz9463 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDForest dynamics arise from the interplay of chronic drivers and transient disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality. The resulting trajectories of vegetation development drive the biomass and species composition of terrestrial ecosystems. Forest dynamics are changing because of anthropogenic-driven exacerbation of chronic drivers, such as rising temperature and CO2, and increasing transient disturbances, including wildfire, drought, windthrow, biotic attack, and land-use change. There are widespread observations of increasing tree mortality due to changing climate and land use, as well as observations of growth stimulation of younger forests due to CO2 fertilization. These antagonistic processes are co-occurring globally, leaving the fate of future forests uncertain. We examine the implications of changing forest demography and its drivers for both future forest management and forecasting impacts of global climate forcing. ADVANCESWe reviewed the literature of forest demographic responses to chronic drivers and transient disturbances to generate hypotheses on future trajectories of these factors and their subsequent impacts on vegetation dynamics, with a focus on forested ecosystems. We complemented this review with analyses of global land-use change and disturbance datasets to independently evaluate the implications of changing drivers and disturbances on global-scale tree demographics. Ongoing changes in environmental drivers and disturbance regimes are consistently increasing mortality and forcing forests toward shorter-statured and younger stands, reducing potential carbon storage. Acclimation, adaptation, and migration may partially mitigate these effects. These increased forest impacts are due to natural disturbances (e.g., wildfire, drought, windthrow, insect or pathogen outbreaks) and land-use change, both of which are predicted to increase in magnitude in the future. Atmospherically derived estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink and remote sensing data indicate that tree growth and potentially recruitment may have increased globally in the 20th century, but the growth of this carbon sink has slowed. Variability in growth stimulation due to CO2 fertilization is evident globally, with observations and experiments suggesting that forests benefit from CO2 primarily in early stages of secondary succession. Furthermore, increased tree growth typically requires sufficient water and nutrients to take advantage of rising CO2. Collectively, the evidence reveals that it is highly likely that tree mortality rates will continue to increase, whereas recruitment and growth will respond to changing drivers in a spatially and temporally variable manner. The net impact will be a reduction in forest canopy cover and biomass. OUTLOOKPervasive shifts in forest vegetation dynamics are already occurring and are likely to accelerate under future global changes, with consequences for biodiversity and climate forcing. This conclusion is robust with respect to the abundant literature evidence and our global assessment of historical demographic changes, but it also forms the basis for hypotheses regarding the patterns and processes underlying the shifts in forest dynamics. These hypotheses will be directly testable using emerging terrestrial and satellite-based observation networks. The existing evidence and newly made observations provide a critical test of Earth system models that continue to improve in their ability to simulate forest dynamics and resulting climate forcing. Ultimately, forest managers and natural resource policies must confront the consequences of changing climate and disturbance regimes to ensure sustainable forests and accrue their associated benefits. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/368/6494/eaaz9463/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A conceptual diagram of the components of forest dynamics and the disturbances that drive them.In the far-left panel, a mature ecosystem is responsive primarily to localized mortality, and the primary drivers of demography are chronically changing variables such as CO2, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In the next panel, the system is disturbed by fire, insect outbreak, or another large-scale perturbation that removes most of the overstory trees, and species adapted to rapid postdisturbance recruitment become established. In the third panel, recruitment and growth dominate demographic processes, with mortality increasing over time as competition leads to self-thinning. In the last panel, a mature ecosystem is dominated by species that have replaced the original community in response to chronic environmental changes, leading to a novel ecosystem. Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances.},

  abstract = {As climate change drives increased drought in many forested regions, mechanistic understanding of the factors conferring drought tolerance in trees is increasingly important. The dendrochronological record provides a window through which we can understand how tree size and traits shape growth responses to droughts. We analyzed tree-ring records for 12 species in a broadleaf deciduous forest in Virginia (USA) to test hypotheses for how tree height, microenvironment characteristics, and species' traits shaped drought responses across the three strongest regional droughts over a 60-yr period. Drought tolerance (resistance, recovery, and resilience) decreased with tree height, which was strongly correlated with exposure to higher solar radiation and evaporative demand. The potentially greater rooting volume of larger trees did not confer a resistance advantage, but marginally increased recovery and resilience, in sites with low topographic wetness index. Drought tolerance was greater among species whose leaves lost turgor (wilted) at more negative water potentials and experienced less shrinkage upon desiccation. The tree-ring record reveals that tree height and leaf drought tolerance traits influenced growth responses during and after significant droughts in the meteorological record. As climate change-induced droughts intensify, tall trees with drought-sensitive leaves will be most vulnerable to immediate and longer-term growth reductions.},

In order to characterize how C cycling is shaped by tree size and drought adaptations and how these patterns relate to spatial and temporal variation in water deficit, we analyze data from three forest dynamics plots spanning a moisture gradient in Panama that have experienced El Ni\~no droughts. At all sites, aboveground C cycle contributions peaked below 50-cm stem diameter, with stems {$\geq$} 50 cm accounting for on average 59\% of live aboveground biomass, 45\% of woody productivity and 49\% of woody mortality. The dominance of drought-avoidance strategies increased interactively with stem diameter and dry season intensity. Although size-related C cycle contributions did not vary systematically across the moisture gradient under nondrought conditions, woody mortality of larger trees was disproportionately elevated under El Ni\~no drought stress. Thus, large ({$>$} 50 cm) stems, which strongly mediate but do not necessarily dominate C cycling, have drought adaptations that compensate for their more challenging hydraulic environment, particularly in drier climates. However, these adaptations do not fully buffer the effects of severe drought, and increased large tree mortality dominates ecosystem-level drought responses.},

Our results show that there are no universal scaling relationships of growth or mortality with size among trees in tropical forests. Observed patterns were consistent with our alternative model in the one site where we had the data necessary to evaluate it, and were inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology in all forests.},

  abstract = {Species data held in museum and herbaria, survey data and opportunistically observed data are a substantial information resource. A key challenge in using these data is the uncertainty about where an observation is located. This is important when the data are used for species distribution modelling (SDM), because the coordinates are used to extract the environmental variables and thus, positional error may lead to inaccurate estimation of the species\textendash environment relationship. The magnitude of this effect is related to the level of spatial autocorrelation in the environmental variables. Using local spatial association can be relevant because it can lead to the identification of the specific occurrence records that cause the largest drop in SDM accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we tested whether the SDM predictions are more affected by positional uncertainty originating from locations that have lower local spatial association in their predictors. We performed this experiment for Spain and the Netherlands, using simulated datasets derived from well known species distribution models (SDMs). We used the K statistic to quantify the local spatial association in the predictors at each species occurrence location. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo simulations was employed to introduce the error in the species locations. The results revealed that positional uncertainty in species occurrence data at locations with low local spatial association in predictors reduced the prediction accuracy of the SDMs. We propose that local spatial association is a way to identify the species occurrence records that require treatment for positional uncertainty. We also developed and present a tool in the R environment to target observations that are likely to create error in the output from SDMs as a result of positional uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Tree-rings offer one of the few possibilities to empirically quantify and reconstruct forest growth dynamics over years to millennia. Contemporaneously with the growing scientific community employing tree-ring parameters, recent research has suggested that commonly applied sampling designs (i.e. how and which trees are selected for dendrochronological sampling) may introduce considerable biases in quantifications of forest responses to environmental change. To date, a systematic assessment of the consequences of sampling design on dendroecological and-climatological conclusions has not yet been performed. Here, we investigate potential biases by sampling a large population of trees and replicating diverse sampling designs. This is achieved by retroactively subsetting the population and specifically testing for biases emerging for climate reconstruction, growth response to climate variability, long-term growth trends, and quantification of forest productivity. We find that commonly applied sampling designs can impart systematic biases of varying magnitude to any type of tree-ring-based investigations, independent of the total number of samples considered. Quantifications of forest growth and productivity are particularly susceptible to biases, whereas growth responses to short-term climate variability are less affected by the choice of sampling design. The world's most frequently applied sampling design, focusing on dominant trees only, can bias absolute growth rates by up to 459\% and trends in excess of 200\%. Our findings challenge paradigms, where a subset of samples is typically considered to be representative for the entire population. The only two sampling strategies meeting the requirements for all types of investigations are the (i) sampling of all individuals within a fixed area; and (ii) fully randomized selection of trees. This result advertises the consistent implementation of a widely applicable sampling design to simultaneously reduce uncertainties in tree-ring-based quantifications of forest growth and increase the comparability of datasets beyond individual studies, investigators, laboratories, and geographical boundaries.},

We constructed common scales of shade, drought, and waterlogging tolerance for 806 North American, European/West Asian, and East Asian temperate shrubs and trees representing about 40\% of the extant natural Northern Hemisphere species pool. These scales were used to test the hypotheses that shade tolerance is negatively related to drought and waterlogging tolerances, and that these correlations vary among continents and plant functional types. We observed significant negative correlations among shade and drought tolerance rankings for all data pooled, and separately for every continent and plant functional type, except for evergreen angiosperms. Another significant trade-off was found for drought and waterlogging tolerance for all continents, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, but not for gymnosperms. For all data pooled, for Europe and East Asia, and for evergreen and deciduous angiosperms, shade tolerance was also negatively associated with waterlogging tolerance. Quantile regressions revealed that the negative relationship between shade and drought tolerance was significant for species growing in deep to moderate shade and that the negative relationship between shade and waterlogging tolerance was significant for species growing in moderate shade to high light, explaining why all relationships between different tolerances were negative according to general regression analyses. Phylogenetic signal in the tolerance to any one of the three environmental factors studied was significant but low, with only 21\textendash 24\% of cladogram nodes exhibiting significant conservatism. The inverse relationships between different tolerances were significant in phylogenetically independent analyses both for the overall pool of species and for two multispecies genera (Pinus and Quercus) for which reliable molecular phylogenies were available. Only 2.6\textendash 10.3\% of the species were relatively tolerant to two environmental stresses simultaneously (tolerance value {$\geq$}3), and only three species were tolerant to all three stresses, supporting the existence of functional trade-offs in adjusting to multiple environmental limitations. These trade-offs represent a constraint for niche differentiation, reducing the diversity of plant responses to the many combinations of irradiance and water supply that are found in natural ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The study of size and its biological consequences \textendash{} called allometry \textendash{} has fascinated biologists for centuries. Recent advances in this area of study have stimulated a renewed interest in these scaling phenomena, especially in terms of the search for mechanistic explanations that transcend mere descriptive phenomenology. These advances are reviewed in the context of plant biology. Allometric derivations are presented that predict how annual growth in total body biomass is partitioned to construct new leaf, stem, and root tissues at the level of an individual plant. Derivations are also presented to predict annual reproductive effort and to predict how the biomass of body parts changes as a function of the number of plants per unit area in communities. The predictions emerging from these derivations are then examined empirically by comparing predicted and observed scaling exponents for each relationship using a world-wide data compendium gathered from the primary literature. These comparisons provide strong statistical support for each of the allometric predictions. This support is taken as evidence that a general unifying allometric theory for plant biology is near at hand. Nevertheless, the validation of this theory requires much additional work and raises a number of procedural and conceptual concerns that must be resolved before a single`global'theory is accepted.},

While a suite of characteristics to identify old trees has been developed, most of these characteristics are for conifers or trees growing in low-density forests. Given that the diverse Eastern Deciduous Forest (EDF) is dominated by a species-rich, angiosperm-dominated woody flora, old-growth forests are scarce in the EDF, and research permits in natural areas often limit the number of trees that can be sampled, having a suite of characteristics that identify old trees for a wider range of species increases the likelihood of efficiently creating longer depths of ecological history. The common indicators of old ({$>$} 250 year old) EDF angiosperms are presented to aid in the recovery and preservation of these living sources of information. Six common external characteristics of old angiosperm trees include: (1) smooth or ``balding'' bark; (2) low stem taper; (3) high stem sinuosity; (4) crowns comprised of few, large-diameter, twisting limbs; (5) low crown volume; and (6) a low ratio of leaf area to trunk volume. The existence of old trees in the landscape can also be related to life-history traits or land-use histories. Both professionals and lay folk can be trained to identify these traits and environmental conditions. While these characteristics and settings generally signal the potential for old trees, there is no guarantee that they represent old ages. However, these characteristics should aid in the discovery of old trees throughout the EDF.},

To understand some of this complexity, we investigated the factors influencing individual growth of Chamaecyparis thyoides over 61 years within 18 populations across the ca 1500 km and 11 degrees of latitude. We then applied a vulnerability framework to understand how the variability of tree growth response to climate varies between populations and regions across our network. Surprisingly, we found the growth of trees in the central portion of our network responded more synchronously to warming and drought than trees in the southern end of our network, suggesting greater vulnerability in the central populations with continued warming. Our analyses and framework approach revealed substantial complexity in growth responses to climate within and between populations. We found potential resiliency within all populations, but higher inter-population than intra-population variability in response to climate. We found that latitude was an important proxy for the growth response to temperatures during the non-growing season and spring, but that ecosystem structure can modify the growth response and vulnerability to drought during the summer. The range of growth responses to warming is greater in the southern populations than in more northernly populations. This asymmetrical distribution of growth response across our study network provides evidence for a kind of ecological hysteresis, more southerly populations could be more resilient with warming. Despite the fact that this species primarily lives in wetlands, we found drought stress to be an important constraint on growth. Our study and analyses help to explain the disparities between forecasts of how climatic change might impact tree species and ecosystems over space.},

Synthesising recent work on drought legacies and other climate-related phenomena, we show tree growth responses to climate are temporally variable, and that abrupt variability is commonly observed in response to diverse events. Thus, we put forth a `growth-climate sensitivity' framework for understanding temporal variability (including non-stationarity) in the sensitivity of tree growth to climate. We argue that temporal variability is ubiquitous, illustrating limits to the ways in which tree growth is often conceptualised. We present two conceptual hypotheses (homoeostatic sensitivity and dynamic sensitivity) for how tree growth sensitivity to climate varies, and evaluate the evidence for each. In doing so, we hope to motivate increased investigation of the temporal variability in tree growth through innovative disturbance or drought experiments, particularly via the inclusion of recovery treatments. Focusing on growth-climate sensitivity and its temporal variability can improve prediction of the future states and functioning of trees under climate change, and has the potential to be incorporable into predictive dynamic vegetation models.},

However, AGB assessment procedures are not fully standardized and even more importantly, the uncertainty associated with AGB estimates is seldom assessed. Here, we present an r package designed to compute both AGB/AGC estimate and its associated uncertainty from forest plot datasets, using a Bayesian inference procedure. The package builds upon previous work on pantropical and regional biomass allometric equations and published datasets by default, but it can also integrate unpublished or complementary datasets in many steps. BIOMASS performs a number of standard tasks on input forest tree inventories: (i) tree species identification, if available, is automatically corrected; (ii) wood density is estimated from tree species identity; (iii) if height data are available, a local height\textendash diameter allometry may be built; else height is inferred from pantropical or regional models; (iv) finally, AGB/AGC are estimated by propagating the errors associated with all the calculation steps up to the final estimate. R code is given in the paper and in the appendix for the purpose of illustration. The BIOMASS package should contribute to improved standards for AGB calculation for tropical forest stands, and will encourage users to report the uncertainties associated with stand-level AGB/AGC estimates in future studies.},

However, analyses of climatic effects on tree growth have primarily focused on the upper canopy, leaving understory dynamics unresolved. We analyzed differences in climate sensitivity based on canopy position of four common tree species (Acer rubrum, Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) using growth information from 1084 trees across eight sites in the northeastern United States. Effects of canopy position on climate response varied, but were significant and often non-linear, for all four species. Compared to overstory trees, understory trees showed stronger reductions in growth at high temperatures and varied shifts in precipitation response. This contradicts the prevailing assumption that climate responses, particularly to temperature, of understory trees are buffered by the overstory. Forest growth trajectories are uncertain in compositionally and structurally complex forests, and future demography and regeneration dynamics may be misinferred if not all canopy levels are represented in future forecasts.},

First, long chronologies for tropical tree species were constructed which allowed climate reconstructions, revealed sources of climatic variation and clarified climate\textendash growth relations. Other studies combined tree-ring data and stable isotope (13C and 18O) measurements to evaluate the response of tropical trees to climatic variation and changes. A second set of studies assessed long-term growth patterns of individual trees throughout their life. These studies enhanced the understanding of growth trajectories to the canopy, quantified autocorrelated tree growth and yielded new estimates of tree ages. Such studies were also used to reconstruct the disturbance history of tropical forests. The last set of studies applied tree-ring data to growth models. Tree-ring data can replace diameter measurements from research plots, provide additional information to construct population models, improve timber yield models and validate model output. Based on our review, we propose two main directions for future research. (1) An evaluation of the causes and consequences of growth variation within and among trees and their relation to environmental variation. Studies evaluating this directly contribute to improved understanding of tropical tree ecology. (2) The simultaneous measurement of widths and stable isotope fractions in tree rings offers the potential to study responses of trees to climatic change. Given the major role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle, knowing these responses is of high priority.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest responses to climate and atmospheric change are critical to the future of the global carbon budget. Recent studies have reported increases in estimated above-ground biomass (EAGB) stocks, productivity, and mortality in old-growth tropical forests. These increases could reflect a shift in forest functioning due to global change and/or long-lasting recovery from past disturbance. We introduce a novel approach to disentangle the relative contributions of these mechanisms by decomposing changes in whole-plot biomass fluxes into contributions from changes in the distribution of gap-successional stages and changes in fluxes for a given stage. Using 30 years of forest dynamic data at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we investigated temporal variation in EAGB fluxes as a function of initial EAGB (EAGBi) in 10 \texttimes{} 10 m quadrats. Productivity and mortality fluxes both increased strongly with initial quadrat EAGB. The distribution of EAGB (and thus EAGBi) across quadrats hardly varied over 30 years (and seven censuses). EAGB fluxes as a function of EAGBi varied largely and significantly among census intervals, with notably higher productivity in 1985\textendash 1990 associated with recovery from the 1982\textendash 1983 El Ni\~no event. Variation in whole-plot fluxes among census intervals was explained overwhelmingly by variation in fluxes as a function of EAGBi, with essentially no contribution from changes in EAGBi distributions. The high observed temporal variation in productivity and mortality suggests that this forest is very sensitive to climate variability. There was no consistent long-term trend in productivity, mortality, or biomass in this forest over 30 years, although the temporal variability in productivity and mortality was so strong that it could well mask a substantial trend. Accurate prediction of future tropical forest carbon budgets will require accounting for disturbance-recovery dynamics and understanding temporal variability in productivity and mortality.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Biota\textendash soil interactions in natural ecosystems are the subject of considerable research. Our hypothesis is that individual trees play a significant role through biomechanical and biochemical disturbances affecting soil formation in temperate forests, resulting in a complex spatial pattern of disturbance regimes and a close relationship between disturbance histories and soil units.  In \v{Z}of\'insk\'y Prales (Czech Republic) \textendash{} the fourth oldest, continuously protected reserve in Europe and the first site of global research network SIGEO (Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatories) in continental Europe \textendash{} we compared extensive dendrochronological, soil and pit\textendash mound microtopography data both temporally and spatially from an area of anthropogenically unaffected 42 ha collected from 2008\textendash 2012. These data sets differ in terms of information complexity and length of memory: tree cores contain complex information about the disturbance history of the past 350 years, footprints of disturbances from the uprooting of a specific tree can persist 1700 years, and soils represent an extensive composite phenotype that has been developing for at least the entire postglacial period (10 500 years).  On average, 6.18\textendash 13.41\% of the canopy on individual soil units was disturbed per decade. Even though the "backbone" of key events in the development of the forest ecosystem remained the same (e.g. the 1870s, 1880s and 1980s), the internal structure of disturbance history often differed among soil units; the most exceptional were Gleysols and Histosols, where important feedback from soil to trees was expected. However, the characteristics of treethrow dynamics as well as the frequencies of stronger releases in core series also significantly differed along a gradient of terrestrial soil weathering and leaching (Haplic Cambisols \textendash{} Dystric Cambisols \textendash{} Entic Podzols \textendash{} Albic Podzols). These results suggest the existence of several disturbance regimes within the forest, controlling fine-scale pedodiversity.},

  abstract = {Question We connected tree-census and dendrochronological research data (74.2 ha) in order to answer the following questions: How do we apply an individual-based approach, which allows us to abandon the traditional patch model, in the research of disturbance history through spatial scales? What is the disturbance history of the natural forest? How do we understand the influence of the Kyrill storm, which affected the reserve on 18 January 2007? How does the disturbance history in dendrochronological records correspond to real disturbances? Location \v{Z}of\'insk\'y Prales (48 \textdegree 40{${'}$} N, 14 \textdegree 42{${'}$} E, 735\textendash 830 m a.s.l., granite, Czech Republic) Methods Repeated tree-censuses ({$>$}20 000 trees) were carried out in 1975, 1997 and 2008. These surveys served as the basis of dendrochronological research, during which 3 020 trees were sampled. A boundary line (BL) approach and geostatistical techniques were used to detect disturbance intensity and its spatial pattern. Results The mean disturbance rate was 11.0\% canopy loss per decade (maximum 33.7\%) in the core zone. Bordering forests were directly affected by humans after 1800. A maximum of nine disturbance events were recorded per tree, but there were also 3\% of non-suppressed trees without records of disturbance events. The Kyrill storm represented a singular event in the forest history from the point of view of its exceptional spatial pattern (ranges up to 320.0 m), but not from the perspective of disturbance intensity. The relationship between disturbance intensity (y) and the range of spatial autocorrelation (x) can be explained by the equation y = 10.6863 + 0.0783*x (R2 = 0.546, P = 0.009). The spatial variability of releases {$\geq$}50\% of BL corresponds to real disturbance events, while the insertion of weak releases led to the overestimation of range. The frequency of releases was affected by a decrease in air pollution at the beginning of the 1990s. Conclusions Effects of small-scale disturbances predominate in forest dynamics. Disturbance intensity was often not directly in accordance with the range of spatial autocorrelation. The ecological role of disturbance is therefore biased if disturbance intensity is used as the sole criterion. The results suggest the importance of historical and geographical contingency in ecosystem development.},

The surveys were made in localities with subsoils poor in nutrients (Boub\'in-Mile\v{s}ice\textemdash 27 plots) and in a locality with nutrient-rich subsoil (Sto\v{z}ec\textemdash 15 plots). Vegetation dynamics were studied according to the year of measurement and the nutrient capacity of the geological bedrock.

Changes in environmental conditions were studied between the years of measurement and between the localities using bioindication\textemdash by the calculation of Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for plant communities. Over 24~years both the nutrient-poor site and the nutrient-rich site showed a considerable reduction in the tree layer cover and conversely the advancement of shrub layers. The coverage degree of dominants in the main tree layer (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Abies alba) markedly decreased. Abies alba also exhibited a pronounced drop in constancy. On the other hand, the lower tree layer and shrub layers in Boub\'in-Mile\v{s}ice exhibited a distinctive invasion of Fagus sylvatica. An increase in the frequency of Sorbus aucuparia and a decrease in the frequency of Ulmus glabra were determined too. Herb layer changes were highly significant between the 1970s and the 1990s with qualitative changes being greater than quantitative changes. The number of species and Shannon\textendash Wiener's index increased. A significant difference was recorded between the nutrient-poor and the nutrient-rich sites in the values of the quantitative similarity of relev\'es with other differences being insignificant. The nutrient-poor sites exhibited herb layer homogenisation. A significant increase of EIV for light was found on both site types. The changes in phytocoenoses were interpreted partly as developmental trends (caused by indirect impact of man\textemdash e.g. fluctuations in game populations since the 18th century, the impact of air pollution); partly as cyclical changes connected with the developmental cycle of the natural temperate forest.},

Furthermore, present competition levels may reflect legacies of past use. Here, we analyze the effects of climate, site conditions and competition on radial growth in three Scots pine stands located along an altitudinal gradient in central Spain. Current stand structure and retrospective analyses of radial growth (basal area increment, BAI) were used to model changes in tree growth as a function of a spatially-explicit competition index (CI) and climate. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to model BAI and to quantify the growth responses to climate of trees under low and high competition levels. Competition effects on growth were steady over time regardless of tree age. High competition levels negatively affected growth since negative exponential functions characterized the CI\textendash BAI relationships. Tree growth sensitivity to climate increased with decreasing competition intensity. Growth at high elevations was mainly limited by low winter temperatures, whereas warm spring enhanced growth at middle elevations and warm late summer temperatures constrained growth at low elevation. Growth responsiveness to climate is enhanced under low competition levels. Overall, current competition is a more relevant driver of recent growth than climate. Proactive forest management should be adopted to reduce the vulnerability of Scots pine forests currently subjected to higher competition levels and warmer and drier conditions.},

  abstract = {Tree growth estimation is a challenging task as difficulties associated with data collection and inference often result in inaccurate estimates. Two main methods for tree growth estimation are diameter tape measurements and increment cores. The former involves repeatedly measuring tree diameters with a cloth or metal tape whose scale has been adjusted to give diameter readings directly. This approach has the advantage that diameters can be measured rapidly. However, because of the substantial error involved during tape measurements, negative diameter increments are often observed. Alternatively, annual radius increment data can be obtained by taking tree cores and averaging repeated measurements of the ring widths. Acquiring and analyzing tree cores is a time-consuming process, and taking multiple cores may have adverse effects on tree health. Therefore, radius increment data are typically only available for a subset of trees within a stand. We offer a fusion of the data sources, which enables us to accommodate missingness and to borrow strength across individuals. It enables individual tree-level inference as well as average or stand level inference. Our model recognizes that tree growth in a given year depends upon tree size at the start of the year as well as levels of appropriate covariates operating in that year. We apply our modeling to a fairly large dataset taken from two forest stands at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachians collected from 1991 to 2011.

Tree rings provide valuable information on climate-driven growth patterns, but existing data tend to be biased toward older trees on climatically extreme sites. Understanding climate change responses of biogeographic regions requires data that integrate spatial variability in growing conditions and forest structure. We analyzed both temporal (c. 1901\textendash 2010) and spatial variation in radial growth patterns in 9,876 trees from fragments of primary Picea abies forests spanning the latitudinal and altitudinal extent of the Carpathian arc. Growth was positively correlated with summer temperatures and spring moisture availability throughout the entire region. However, important seasonal variation in climate responses occurred along geospatial gradients. At northern sites, winter precipitation and October temperatures of the year preceding ring formation were positively correlated with ring width. In contrast, trees at the southern extent of the Carpathians responded negatively to warm and dry conditions in autumn of the year preceding ring formation. An assessment of regional synchronization in radial growth variability showed temporal fluctuations throughout the 20th century linked to the onset of moisture limitation in southern landscapes. Since the beginning of the study period, differences between high and low elevations in the temperature sensitivity of tree growth generally declined, while moisture sensitivity increased at lower elevations. Growth trend analyses demonstrated changes in absolute tree growth rates linked to climatic change, with basal area increments in northern landscapes and lower altitudes responding positively to recent warming. Tree growth has predominantly increased with rising temperatures in the Carpathians, accompanied by early indicators that portions of the mountain range are transitioning from temperature to moisture limitation. Continued warming will alleviate large-scale temperature constraints on tree growth, giving increasing weight to local drivers that are more challenging to predict.},

  abstract = {The long-standing view that biomass growth in trees typically follows a rise-and-fall unimodal pattern has been challenged by studies concluding that biomass growth increases with size even among the largest stems in both closed forests and in open competition-free environments. We highlight challenges and pitfalls that influence such interpretations. The ability to observe and calibrate biomass change in large stems requires adequate data regarding these specific stems. Data checking and control procedures can bias estimates of biomass growth and generate false increases with stem size. It is important to distinguish aggregate and individual-level trends: a failure to do so results in flawed interpretations. Our assessment of biomass growth in 706 tropical forest stems indicates that individual biomass growth patterns often plateau for extended periods, with no significant difference in the number of stems indicating positive and negative trends in all but one of the 14 species. Nonetheless, when comparing aggregate growth during the most recent five years, 13 out of our 14 species indicate that biomass growth increases with size even among the largest sizes. Thus, individual and aggregate patterns of biomass growth with size are distinct. Claims concerning general biomass growth patterns for large trees remain unconvincing. We suggest how future studies can improve our knowledge of growth patterns in and among large trees. A lay summary is available for this article.},

We climbed 140 trees in old-growth redwood forests across California, USA, spanning a broad range of sizes and including the tallest, largest, and oldest known living individuals (i.e., 115.86 vs. 96.29 m tall, 424 vs. 582 Mg aboveground dry mass, and 2510 vs. 3240 years old for Sequoia and Sequoiadendron, respectively). We used a combination of direct measurements, hierarchical sampling, and dendrochronology to quantify tree structure and annual growth increments through old age. We also developed equations to predict aboveground attributes of standing redwoods via ground-based measurements. Compared to Sequoia, Sequoiadendron develops thicker bark on lower trunks, provisions leaves with more sapwood, and delays heartwood production throughout the crown. Main trunk wood volume growth (up to 1.6 vs. 0.9 m3/yr), aboveground biomass growth (up to 0.77 vs. 0.45 Mg/yr), and aboveground growth efficiency (0.55 {$\pm$} 0.04 vs. 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.01 kg annual growth per kg leaves, mean {$\pm$} SE) are all higher in Sequoia. Two independent dimensions of structure\textemdash size and aboveground vigor\textemdash are the strongest predictors of tree-level productivity in both species. A third dimension, relative trunk size, is a significant predictor of growth in Sequoia such that trees with relatively large main trunks compared to their crowns produce more wood annually. Similar-size trees grow at similar rates regardless of latitude or elevation in tall forests of each species. Recent annual growth increments are higher than in the past for the majority of trees, and old trees are just as responsive to environmental changes as young trees. Negative growth\textendash age relationships in previous centuries and positive growth\textendash age relationships in recent decades reflect sampling bias and shifting disturbance regimes. Overall, we find little (if any) evidence for negative effects of old age on tree-level productivity in either species. Except for recovery periods following temporary reductions in crown size, annual increments of wood volume and biomass growth increase as redwoods enlarge with age until extrinsic forces cause tree death.},

  abstract = {How long forest trees can sustain wood production with increasing age remains an open question, primarily because whole-crown structure and growth cannot be readily measured from the ground or on felled trees. We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species \textendash{} Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens \textendash{} representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85\% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351m3) than contained in any tree we measured {$<$}1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

  abstract = {Determining the response of forest growth and productivity to climate variability is crucial for understanding and modeling forest carbon sequestration in mesic temperate forests. Most tree-ring analyses have used monthly climate data. Daily climate data may be more appropriate to use in the determination of tree-ring response to climate because cell division, enlargement, and thickening occur during discrete periods of the growing season. We analyze annual tree-ring width and {$\delta$}13C from Tsuga canadensis (1992\textendash 2012) at ten sites in the northeastern US to test the null hypothesis that tree-ring width and {$\delta$}13C respond similarly to critical climate periods using daily climate data and linear regression. There was a significant difference in the climate response of ring width and {$\delta$}13C. Precipitation predicted both {$\delta$}13C and ring width with the highest r2 and greatest level of significance overall. {$\delta$}13C integrated climate over longer periods of the year (and previous year) than ring width at most sites. {$\delta$}13C showed a more consistent seasonal signal across sites for each climate variable than ring width. Our work provides a new perspective on the response of annual tree growth and {$\delta$}13C to climatic variability that can inform ecosystem productivity, carbon cycle, and earth system models.},

This book--a seminal study in its field--provides a simple yet eloquent introduction to the discipline, explaining what a dendrochronologist does both in the field and in the laboratory. Authors Stokes and Smiley first explain the basic principles of tree-ring dating, then describe details of the process, step by step, from the time a sample is collected until it is incorporated into a master chronology. The book focuses on coniferous evergreens of the Southwest, particularly pi\textendash ons, because they have wide geographic distribution, constitute a large population, and show excellent growth response to certain controlling factors. The book is specifically concerned with the task of establishing a calendar date for a wood or charcoal specimen. This concise but thorough explication of an important discipline will make dendrochonology more meaningful to students and professionals in archaeology, forestry, hydrology, and global change.},

We reviewed studies on tree and forest decline in Northeast and Southeast Asia, Siberia, and the Russian Far East (hereafter referred to as East Asia). This included studies published in domestic journals and languages. We identified information about the locations, causes, periods, and tree species exhibiting decline. Past air pollution was also reviewed. Most East Asian countries show declining trends in SO2 concentration in recent years, although Mongolia and Russia show increasing trends. Ozone (O3) concentrations are stable or gradually increasing in the East Asia region, with high maxima. Wet nitrogen (N) deposition was high in China and tropical countries, but low in Russia. The decline of trees and forests primarily occurred in the mid-latitudes of Japan, Korea, China, and Russia. Long-term large N deposition resulted in the N saturation phenomenon in Japan and China, but no clear forest health response was observed. Thereafter, forest decline symptoms, suspected to be caused by O3, were observed in Japan and China. In East Russia, tree decline occurred around industrial centers in Siberia. Haze events have been increasing in tropical and boreal forests, and particulate matter inhibits photosynthesis. In recent years, chronically high O3 concentrations, in conjunction with climate change, are likely have adverse effects on tree physiology. The effects of air pollution and related factors on tree decline are summarized. Recently, the effects of air pollution on tree decline have not been apparent under the changing climate, however, monitoring air pollution is indispensable for identifying the cause of tree decline. Further economic growth is projected in Southeast Asia and therefore, the monitoring network should be expanded to tropical and boreal forest zones. Countermeasures such as restoring urban trees and rural forests are important for ensuring future ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Currently, the temperate forest biome cools the earth's climate and dampens anthropogenic climate change. However, climate change will substantially alter forest dynamics in the future, affecting the climate regulation function of forests. Increasing natural disturbances can reduce carbon uptake and evaporative cooling, but at the same time increase the albedo of a landscape. Simultaneous changes in vegetation composition can mitigate disturbance impacts, but also influence climate regulation directly (e.g., via albedo changes). As a result of a number of interactive drivers (changes in climate, vegetation, and disturbance) and their simultaneous effects on climate-relevant processes (carbon exchange, albedo, latent heat flux) the future climate regulation function of forests remains highly uncertain. Here we address these complex interactions to assess the effect of future forest dynamics on the climate system. Our specific objectives were (1) to investigate the long-term interactions between changing vegetation composition and disturbance regimes under climate change, (2) to quantify the response of climate regulation to changes in forest dynamics, and (3) to identify the main drivers of the future influence of forests on the climate system. We investigated these issues using the individual-based forest landscape and disturbance model (iLand). Simulations were run over 200 yr for Kalkalpen National Park (Austria), assuming different future climate projections, and incorporating dynamically responding wind and bark beetle disturbances. To consistently assess the net effect on climate the simulated responses of carbon exchange, albedo, and latent heat flux were expressed as contributions to radiative forcing. We found that climate change increased disturbances (+27.7\% over 200 yr) and specifically bark beetle activity during the 21st century. However, negative feedbacks from a simultaneously changing tree species composition (+28.0\% broadleaved species) decreased disturbance activity in the long run (-10.1\%), mainly by reducing the host trees available for bark beetles. Climate change and the resulting future forest dynamics significantly reduced the climate regulation function of the landscape, increasing radiative forcing by up to +10.2\% on average over 200 yr. Overall, radiative forcing was most strongly driven by carbon exchange. We conclude that future changes in forest dynamics can cause amplifying climate feedbacks from temperate forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Drought is a recurring phenomenon in the American Southwest. Since the frequency and severity of hydrologic droughts and other hydroclimatic events are of critical importance to the ecology and rapidly growing human population of this region, knowledge of long-term natural hydroclimatic variability is valuable for resource managers and policy-makers. An October\textendash June precipitation reconstruction for the period AD 824\textendash 2007 was developed from multi-century tree-ring records of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Pinus strobiformis (Southwestern white pine) and Pinus ponderosa (Ponderosa pine) for the Jemez Mountains in Northern New Mexico. Calibration and verification statistics for the period 1896\textendash 2007 show a high level of skill, and account for a significant portion of the observed variance ({$>$}50\%) irrespective of which period is used to develop or verify the regression model. Split-sample validation supports our use of a reconstruction model based on the full period of reliable observational data (1896\textendash 2007). A recent segment of the reconstruction (2000\textendash 2006) emerges as the driest 7-year period sensed by the trees in the entire record. That this period was only moderately dry in precipitation anomaly likely indicates accentuated stress from other factors, such as warmer temperatures. Correlation field maps of actual and reconstructed October\textendash June total precipitation, sea surface temperatures and 500-mb geopotential heights show characteristics that are similar to those indicative of El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation patterns, particularly with regard to ocean and atmospheric conditions in the equatorial and north Pacific. Our 1184-year reconstruction of hydroclimatic variability provides long-term perspective on current and 20th century wet and dry events in Northern New Mexico, is useful to guide expectations of future variability, aids sustainable water management, provides scenarios for drought planning and as inputs for hydrologic models under a broader range of conditions than those provided by historical climate records.

They claim that our tree-ring data contain evidence for historical growth stimulation that was concealed due to failing regeneration in several species. Here we show that (i) the correction method proposed by Brienen et al. induces a bias towards finding positive growth trends, (ii) the results of Brienen et al. rest on selective removal of species, (iii) there is a simple and effective way to accommodate effects of recruitment failure by subsetting data, and (iv) the application of this method confirms our earlier findings. Thus, our results are robust to effects of recruitment failure and our conclusions remain unchanged: we find no evidence for historical growth changes in our studied tree species.},

  abstract = {Despite experimental evidence showing that elevated CO2 levels increase growth in most plants, the isolation of a signal consistent with anthropogenically caused increases in atmospheric CO2 from the dendrochronological record has shown mixed results. Our extensive sets of tree ring data from the Ozark Mountains in Missouri showed that since 1850, Quercus velutina Lam., Quercus coccinea Muench., and Pinus echinata Mill. trees increased in stem growth coincidently with increases in atmospheric CO2. Those long-term increases in radial growth appear unrelated to historical disturbance levels for the region, to long-term changes in relevant climatic variables, or to productivity of sites sampled for the purpose of creating a time sequence of tree ring growth. It is still unclear what the potential role of nitrogen deposition might have been for tree growth. We cross-dated a large number of increment cores and aligned the ring width data by pith date for accurate age constant assessments of growth over the past 150 years. Thus, we circumvented changes in growth trend associated with differences in physiological functioning during development, as well as the need for statistical detrending that removes an unknown degree of long-term environmental signal, the so called segment length curse that applies to standard dendrochronological investigations. When the positive relationship between CO2 and ring width was examined at different ages, an ontogenetic decline in the rate of growth stimulation was found. Specifically, both the pooled Quercus spp. and P. echinata were characterized by a negative exponential pattern of response over a developmental sequence through age 50. Further knowledge of an intrinsic decline in CO2 sensitivity with tree age or size such as this may be important for increased accuracy in estimating terrestrial carbon stocks across successional landscapes.},

Research findings are compared with results from repeated tree layer measurements in eight of the most well-preserved reserves of fir\textendash beech stands in the region. Documentary evidence is provided showing that the historical and contemporary spontaneous development of fir\textendash beech stands throughout the northern Carpathians is identical. The replacement of beech by fir occurred predominantly in the period from the 15\textendash 18th centuries, primarily due to grazing and litter raking. Starting in the 19th century, fir was replaced predominantly by beech under the influence of changing social conditions, since the dieback of the ``grazing'' fir generation had not yet been completed. Air pollution damage and other factors in the fir dieback were only secondary accelerating phenomena. These changes of tree species cannot be interpreted as the natural rotation of two beech generations within the life cycle of one fir generation, as has been the previous explanation. The development is rather a linear trend induced by man, which has occurred simultaneously throughout the northern Carpathians. The current dynamics of spontaneous development are affected by the high stock of hoofed game and by the absence or reduced numbers of predators.},

  abstract = {Once forests have achieved a full canopy, their growth rate declines progressively with age. This work used a global data set with estimates from a wide range of forest types, aged 20-795~years, of their annual photosynthetic production (gross primary production, GPP) and subsequent above- plus below-ground biomass production (net primary production, NPP). Both GPP and NPP increased with increasing mean annual temperature and precipitation. GPP was then unrelated to forest age whilst NPP declined progressively with increasing age. These results implied that autotrophic respiration increases with age. It has been proposed that GPP should decline in response to increasing water stress in leaves as water is raised to greater heights as trees grow taller with age. However, trees may make substantial plastic adjustment in morphology and anatomy of newly developing leaves, xylem and fine roots to compensate for this stress and maintain GPP with age. This work reviews the possibilities that NPP declines with age as respiratory costs increase progressively in, any or all of, the construction and maintenance of more complex tissues, the maintenance of increasing amounts of live tissue within the sapwood of stems and coarse roots, the conversion of sapwood to heartwood, the increasing distance of phloem transport, increased turnover rates of fine roots, cost of supporting very tall trees that are unable to compensate fully for increased water stress in their canopies or maintaining alive competitively unsuccessful small trees.},

We derive a forest drought-stress index (FDSI) for the southwestern United States using a comprehensive tree-ring data set representing AD 1000\textendash 2007. The FDSI is approximately equally influenced by the warm-season vapour-pressure deficit (largely controlled by temperature) and cold-season precipitation, together explaining 82\% of the FDSI variability. Correspondence between the FDSI and measures of forest productivity, mortality, bark-beetle outbreak and wildfire validate the FDSI as a holistic forest-vigour indicator. If the vapour-pressure deficit continues increasing as projected by climate models, the mean forest drought-stress by the 2050s will exceed that of the most severe droughts in the past 1,000 years. Collectively, the results foreshadow twenty-first-century changes in forest structures and compositions, with transition of forests in the southwestern United States, and perhaps water-limited forests globally, towards distributions unfamiliar to modern civilization.},

The underlying assumption is a stationary (time-stable), quasi-linear relationship between tree growth and environment, which however conflicts with basic ecological and evolutionary theory. Indeed, our global assessment of the relevant tree-ring literature demonstrates non-stationarity in the majority of tested cases, not limited to specific proxies, environmental parameters, regions or species. Non-stationarity likely represents the general nature of the relationship between tree-growth proxies and environment. Studies assuming stationarity however score two times more citations influencing other fields of science and the science\textendash policy interface. To reconcile ecological reality with the application of tree-ring proxies for climate or environmental estimates, we provide a clarification of the stationarity concept, propose a simple confidence framework for the re-evaluation of existing studies and recommend the use of a new statistical tool to detect non-stationarity in tree-ring proxies. Our contribution is meant to stimulate and facilitate discussion in light of our results to help increase confidence in tree-ring-based climate and environmental estimates for science, the public and policymakers.},
