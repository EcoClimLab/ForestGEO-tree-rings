These figures are produced in EcoClimLab/ForestGEO_dendro. They are updated every time the [SI file](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/ForestGEO-tree-rings/blob/master/doc/manuscript/ForestGEO_treerings_SI.Rmd) is knit.

These distributions approximates-- but does not entirely match -- the age distribution of trees included in the analysis. The core record start year can occur after a tree's recruitment year (i.e., year when the tree reached coring height) if the core fails to hit center or if the tree's center is lost to heartrot.
